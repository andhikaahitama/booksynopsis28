<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Acing Criminal Law (Acing Series)</h2><p>This study aid features an innovative method of content organization. It uses a checklist format to lead students through questions they need to ask to fully evaluate the legal problem they are trying to solve. It also synthesizes the material in a way that most students are unable to do on their own, and assembles the different issues, presenting a clear guide to procedural analysis that students can draw upon when writing their exams. Other study aids provide sample problems, but none offer the systematic approach to problem solving found in this book.</p><p></p><h2>Loneliness</h2><p>Explores the problems that face man in his alienation from himself and others, and finds answers in existential philosophy</p><p></p><h2>Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled</h2><p><p>If there&#x2019;s one question that many parents would rather not hear when Sophia or Aiden gets home from school, it&#x2019;s, &#x201c;Mom, can you help me with my algebra homework?&#x201d;</p><p>And nowadays that question gets asked by younger and younger children because algebraic thinking has been inserted into the math curriculum as early as 5th grade, sometimes even in 4th grade!<br><br> So what helps parents recall algebra and also helps students learn it in a friendly way? The Algebra Survival Guide, now updated in its Second Edition.<br><br> Following on the success of the award-winning First Edition book and written by teacher/tutor Josh Rappaport, the Second Edition Guide offers time-tested advice for understanding the key areas of this gateway math subject.<br><br> The new Algebra Survival Guide features a unique Q&amp;A format so students hear their own questions echoed in the text. The book&#x2019;s answers, written in the voice of a friendly tutor, provide conversational responses, along with step-by-step instructions in English right next to the math steps.<br><br> Each page is a one-page mini-lesson so students can focus without feeling overwhelmed. Following each lesson is a short set of practice problems, offering students instant feedback. At the end of each section, chapter tests provide comprehensive checks on understanding.<br><br> Since word problems are often the highest &#x201c;hurdle&#x201d; of algebra, the Second Edition contains a new 62-page chapter on advanced word problems. This chapter provides detailed strategies for setting up and solving word problems on such dastardly areas as rate, time and distance, work performed, mixture formulas, and even those crazy problems about Joe being three years older than four times Jane&#x2019;s age 10 years in the future.</p><p>In its twelve content chapters the 352-page Second Edition covers all key areas of PreAlgebra and Algebra 1: Algebraic Properties, Sets of Numbers, Positive and Negative Numbers, Order of Operations, Absolute Value, Exponents, Radicals, Factoring, Cancelling, Solving Equations, the Coordinate Plane, and Word Problems.<br><br> As a major bonus, the Guide buzzes with lively illustrations by award-winning artist Sally Blakemore. Ms. Blakemore&#x2019;s cartoons not only provide comic relief, they also offer a visual way to grasp algebra&#x2019;s challenging abstractions. (Example: &nbsp;to illustrate the Reflexive Property of x = x, a cartoon shows a sad &#x2018;x&#x2019; gazing at itself in the mirror while suffering a &#x2018;bad hair day.&#x2019;) With all of these features, the Second Edition Algebra Survival Guide appeals equally to homeschoolers, students, parents, teachers, tutors and adult students striving to recall the math they learned a decade or so ago.</p><p>The Second Edition aligns with the Common Core State Standards for Math, so it&#x2019;s up-to-date for today&#x2019;s teachers.<br><br> Loaded with thorough explanations, practice problems and answers, the new Algebra Survival Guide gives anyone and everyone the needed boost for learning or teaching the timeless and critical subject of algebra.</p></p><p><p>Josh Rappaport is the author of the Parents' Choice award-winning Algebra Survival Guide, the Algebra Survival Workbook and PreAlgebra Blastoff.

This simple question, at the very heart of the hybrid field of biological anthropology, poses one of the false of dichotomies&#x2014;with a stereotypical humanist answering in the affirmative and a stereotypical scientist answering in the negative.</p> <p>The <em>study </em>of human biology is different from the study of the biology of other species. In the simplest terms, people's lives and welfare may depend upon it, in a sense that they may not depend on the study of other scientific subjects. Where science is used to validate ideas&#x2014;four out of five scientists preferring a brand of cigarettes or toothpaste&#x2014;there is a tendency to accept the judgment as authoritative without asking the kinds of questions we might ask of other citizens' pronouncements.</p> <p>In <em>Human Biodiversity, </em>Marks has attempted to distill from a centuries-long debate what has been learned and remains to be learned about the biological differences within and among human groups. His is the first such attempt by an anthropologist in years, for genetics has undermined the fundamental assumptions of racial taxonomy. The history of those assumptions from Linnaeus to the recent past&#x2014;the history of other, more useful assumptions that derive from Buffon and have reemerged to account for genetic variation&#x2014;are the poles of Marks's exploration.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan Marks is a professor of anthropology, at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. He earned his M.S. in genetics, and M.A. and Ph.D. in anthropology at the University of Arizona, and has conducted postdoctoral research in genetics at the University of California at Davis. Mark's work on "molecular anthropology" has been widely published in professional journals.</p><p> &#x201c;Outstanding Title!... Marks traces the history of scientific attempts to describe and account for human biological variation. Covering the 17th century to the present, his study stresses the derivation of scientific ideas from the social problems and values with which they share history... A highly readable, thought-provoking, and comprehensive treatment of popular and scholarly interest in race and human variation. General readers; upper-division undergraduates and above.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;S. A. Quandt, <em>Choice</em></p> <p> &#x201c;[Jonathan Marks&#x2019;s] thoughtful and witty book is about one of the &#x201c;wrongest&#x201d; of scientific notions: namely, the idea that the human species can be divided into discrete biological subunits, or races.... Marks casts his book as both an introduction to the current state of human genetics and a cautionary historical tale about what happens when scientists do not examine their most basic assumptions. Beginning in 1699 with the publication of Edward Tyson&#x2019;s famous comparison of a human and a chimp, Marks structures his historical account around the assumptions that have given rise to the 20th-century biological concept of race.... What Marks has given us is truly a &#x201c;people&#x2019;s history of human biodiversity.&#x201d; I do not know of a more lively and heartfelt introduction.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Misia Landau, <em>American Anthropologist</em></p></p><h2>Performance Measurement and Control Systems for Implementing Strategy</h2><p>For undergraduate Management Control Systems courses and other MBA Management Accounting and Control electives.

Straightforward in its presentation and generous in its real-life examples, <i>The Four Pillars of Investing</i> presents a no-nonsense discussion of:</p> <ul> <li>The art and science of mixing different asset classes into an effective blend</li> <li>The dangers of actively picking stocks, as opposed to investing in the whole market</li> <li>Behavioral finance and how state of mind can adversely affect decision making</li> <li>Reasons the mutual fund and brokerage industries, rather than your partners, are often your most direct competitors</li> <li>Strategies for managing all of your assets&#x2015;savings, 401(k)s, home equity&#x2015;as one portfolio</li> </ul> <p>Investing is not a destination. It is a journey, and along the way are stockbrokers, journalists, and mutual fund companies whose interests are diametrically opposed to yours.</p> <p>More relevant today than ever, <i>The Four Pillars of Investing</i> shows you how to determine your own financial direction and assemble an investment program with the sole goal of building long-term wealth for you and your family.</p></p><p><p><b>William J.

Spacesuits: Within the Collections of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum takes the reader through the development of the last category, the spacesuits used during this venture. Highlighting the pressure suits created during the years leading up to the lunar missions and beyond, this book features dramatic photographs of the Smithsonian&#x2019;s collection, as well as never-before-published historical images of spacesuit development and testing&#x2014;range-of-motion studies, for example, in which researchers wore spacesuits while playing baseball and football. The book also includes a group of advanced spacesuits, which, though never used on a mission, are in many respects the most exciting suits ever created. One suit glove has steel fingernails and sharkskin pads, in an attempt to harness the abilities of the human hand. <br><br>Spacesuits are surprisingly fragile; they are made for a short lifespan in the most extreme of conditions, and long-term survival is not part of their design process. The final chapter touches briefly on the current conditions of historic suits, how they have held up over time, the reasons for their deterioration, and the rewards and difficulties associated with caring for and preserving these very complex and iconic artifacts. From the first spacesuit designs of the 1930s through those worn on the landmark Apollo-Soyuz program of 1975, <i><b>Spacesuits </b></i>provides a behind-the-scenes look at the history of these remarkable creations, including some that have never before been publicly displayed.</p><p><b>Amanda Young</b> is a museum specialist in <i>Spacesuits and Astronaut Equipment</i> for the Division of Space History of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

Famous and beloved during her lifetime all over Latin America and in Europe, Mistral has never been known in North America as she deserves to be. The reputation of her more flamboyant and accessible friend and countryman Pablo Neruda has overshadowed hers, and she has been officially sentimentalized into a "poetess" of children and motherhood. Translations, and even selections of her work in Spanish, have tended to underplay the darkness, the strangeness, and the raging intensity of her poems of grief and pain, the yearning power of her evocations of the Chilean landscape, the stark music of her Round Dances, the visionary splendor of her Hymns of America.</p><p>During her lifetime Mistral published four books: <i>Desolation, Tenderness, Clearcut,</i> and <i>Winepress.</i> These are included in the "Complete" Nobel edition published in Madrid; the <i>Poem of Chile</i>, her last book, was printed years after her death. Le Guin includes poems from all five books in this volume, with particular emphasis on the later work. The intelligence and passion of Le Guin's selection and translation will finally allow people in the North to hear the originality, power, purity, and intransigence of this great American voice.</p><p>Le Guin has published five volumes of her own poetry, an English version of Lao Tzu's <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, and a volume of mutual translation with the Argentine poet Diana Bellessi, <i>The Twins, the Dream/Las Gemalas, El Sue�o.</i> Strongly drawn to Mistral's work as soon as she discovered it, Le Guin has been working on this translation for five years.</p></p><p>For the first time, the breadth and depth of Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral&#x2019;s poetry is passionately translated to English by Le Guin in this landmark bilingual edition.The breadth and depth of Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral&#39;s poetry is passionately translated to English by Le Guin in this landmark bilingual edition.</p><h2>Neuropsychological Evaluation of the Child</h2><p>This essential desk reference will meet the demand for a broad and convenient collection of normative data in child neuropsychology. In a clearly written, well-organized manner, it compiles published and previously unpublished normative data for the neuropsychological tests that are most commonly used with children. Far from being a raw collection, however, it integrates concepts and models central to the neuropsychological assessment of children into the discussions of data. All these discussions have a practical, clinical focus. As background, the author considers the current status of child neuropsychology practice, test models, behavioral assessment techniques, observational data, procedures to optimize child evaluation, communication of results through the interpretive session and report writing, and preliminary assessment methods. Then she reviews the tests and data under the broad domains of intelligence, executive function, attention, language, motor and sensory-perceptual function, visuoperceptual, visuospatial and visuoconstructional function, and learning and memory. Written by a seasoned practitioner, this book will be an extraordinary resource for child and developmental neuropsychologists, clinical psychologists, child neurologists, and their students and trainees.<br></p><p>Ida Sue Baron is Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at The George Washington University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C.<br>"With the publication of [this book] the discipline of pediatric neuropsychology is forever changed.

But the understanding of ragtime and its era has been clouded by a history of murky impressions, half-truths, and inventive fictions. Ragtime: A Musical and Cultural History cuts through the murkiness. A methodical survey of thousands of rags along with an examination of then-contemporary opinions in magazines and newspapers demonstrate how the music evolved and how America responded to it. "The most complete available discussion of ragtime" (Floyd &amp; Reisser, Black Music in the United States).</p><p>Edward A. Berlin&#39;s books, articles, and lectures have changed our understanding of ragtime history.

The basic Venn diagram is both elegantly simple&#x2015;three overlapping circles that intersect to create eight distinct areas&#x2015;and conceptually innovative. Devised by English logician John Venn (1834&#x2013;1923) to visually represent complex logical propositions and algebraic statements, the diagrams drew the excited interest of both scholars and the general public.</p><p>In <i>Cogwheels of the Mind</i>, statistician and geneticist A. W. F. Edwards provides an accessible and engaging history of the Venn diagram, its reception and evolution, and its presence in such objects and images as Christian iconography, tennis balls, and flags which provide a rich source of Venn diagrams for Edwards, including those of Switzerland, Poland, and Japan (all one-set Venn diagrams), Greenland (a two-set Venn diagram), and Maryland (a three-set device).</p><p>Edwards begins with a sketch of Venn's life, his discovery of the three-circle design while developing a series of lectures on symbolic logic at Cambridge University, and the publication of his find in an 1880 paper, and, more influentially, his 1881 book, <i>Symbolic Logic</i>. Edwards discusses the rival diagrammatic scheme invented by Charles Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, who also developed a board game based on his design. The author also recreates famous Venn diagrams from history, including Winston Churchill's of 1948 depicting the mutual interests of the British Empire, a united Europe, and the English-speaking world, with the United Kingdom located at the intersection.</p><p>Edwards goes on to show how different shapes can be linked together to form artistically beautiful and mathematically important, multi-set Venn diagrams, including the author's own influential Adelaide variation. And he delineates the possibilities for expanding the analytic power of these diagrams far beyond those first appreciated by Venn. Edwards even tells readers how to draw complex Venn diagrams on a spherical surface to create "Vennis balls." For anyone interested in mathematics or its history, <i>Cogwheels of the Mind</i> is invaluable and compelling reading.</p></p><p><p><b>A. W. F. Edwards </b> is, like John Venn before him, a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He is the author of <i>Likelihood</i> and <i>Pascal's Arithmetical Triangle</i>, both available from Johns Hopkins.</p><p>"Edwards arrives with this pleasing little history about who John Venn was, why he conceived of the diagram, and the properties that lie secreted beneath such a seemingly simple mathematical object...

Ferris</p><p></p><h2>Leopard</h2><p>A classic of modern fiction. Set in the 1860s, THE LEOPARD is the spellbinding story of a decadent, dying Sicilian aristocracy threatened by the approaching forces of democracy and revolution.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><i>The Leopard</i> is set in Sicily in 1860, as Italian unification is coming violently into being, but it transcends the historical-novel classification. E.M. Forster called it, instead, "a novel which happens to take place in history." Lampedusa's Sicily is a land where each social gesture is freighted with nuance, threat, and nostalgia, and his skeptical protagonist, Don Fabrizio, is uniquely placed to witness all and alter absolutely nothing. Like his creator, the prince is an aristocrat and an astronomer, a man "watching the ruin of his own class and his own inheritance without ever making, still less wanting to make, any move toward saving it." Far better to take refuge in the night skies. <p> What renders <i>The Leopard</i> so beautiful, and so despairing, is Lampedusa's grasp of human frailty and his vision of Sicily's arid terrain--"comfortless and irrational, with no lines that the mind could grasp, conceived apparently in a delirious moment of creation; a sea suddenly petrified at the instant when a change of wind had flung waves into frenzy." Though the author had long had the book in mind, he didn't begin writing it until he was in his late 50s. He died at 60, soon after it was rejected as unpublishable. </p><p> Archibald Colquhoun's lyrical translation also contains 70 more precious pages of Lampedusa--a memoir, a short story, and the first chapter of a novel. In "Places of My Infancy" the author warns that "the reader (who won't exist) must expect to be led meandering through a lost Earthly Paradise. If it bores him. I don't mind." Luckily, the reader does exist; even more luckily, boredom is not an option.</p>Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa was born in Palermo, Italy in 1896. With the commencement of the First World War he found himself fighting in the battle of Caporetto, from which he was captured and taken prisoner by the Austro-Hungarian army. He eventually escaped and returned to Italy. Although he did produce other works, he is most known for his novel <i>The Leopard</i>.</p><h2>Mind of the Strategist</h2><p>A guide to the strategic planning techniques used by Japanese business executives explains how to identify the customer&#39;s needs, evaluate the strengths of the company, and overcome competition</p><p><p><b>A Masterful Analysis of Company, Customer, and Competition</b></p> <p>Kenichi Ohmae-voted by <i>The Economist</i> as &#x201c;one of the world's top five management gurus&#x201d;-changed the landscape of management strategy in <i>The Mind of the Strategist</i>.

Demonstrates how moral man has been replaced by mental patient in modern society, how sin has been converted to mental illness as a way of controlling undesirables. Deals with psychiatry as a social control medium, how it disposes of those persons unwanted by society, and presents a compelling argument for limiting coercive powers of psychiatry to take away people&#39;s personal freedom and relieve them of their personal responsibility.</p><p>Cruel Compassion is the capstone of Thomas Szasz&#39;s critique of psychiatric practices. Reexamining psychiatric interventions from a cultural-historical and political-economic perspective, Szasz demonstrates that the main problem that faces mental health policy makers today is adult dependency. Millions of Americans, diagnosed as mentally ill, are drugged and confined by doctors for noncriminal conduct, go legally unpunished for the crimes they commit, and are supported by the state - not because they are sick, but because they are unproductive and unwanted. Obsessed with the twin beliefs that misbehavior is a medical disorder and that the duty of the state is to protect adults from themselves, we have replaced criminal-punitive sentences with civil-therapeutic &#39;programs.&#39; The result is the relentless loss of individual liberty, erosion of personal responsibility, and destruction of the security of persons and property - symptoms of the transformation of a Constitutional Republic into a Therapeutic State, unconstrained by the rule of law. Szasz shows convincingly that not until we separate therapy from coercion - much as the founders separated theology from coercion - shall we be able to get a handle on our seemingly intractable psychiatric and social problems. No contemporary thinker has done more than Thomas Szasz to expose the myths and misconceptions surrounding insanity and the practice of psychiatry. Now, in Cruel Compassion, he gives us a sobering look at some of our most cherished notions about our humane treatment of society&#39;s unwanted, and perhaps more importantly, about ourselves as a compassionate and democratic people.</p><h2>The Cibecue Apache</h2><p>Cultural anthropologist Keith H.

It captures the true character of Apache culture not only because of its objective analyses and descriptions but also because of the author's belief in allowing the people to speak for themselves. Basso learned their language, became a trusted friend and intimate, and returned to the field often to gather data, participate, and observe.</p><p> Basso's goal in this now-classic work is to describe Cibecue Apache perceptions, experiences, conflicts, and indecision.

The book also incorporates a comprehensive catalogue of relevant vase-paintings, compiled by noted archaeologist Keith DeVries.

Fuelled by Orwell's intense disillusionment with Soviet Communism, <i>Animal Farm</i> is a nearly perfect piece of writing--both an engaging story and an allegory that actually works. When the downtrodden beasts of Manor Farm oust their drunken human master and take over management of the land, all are awash in collectivist zeal. Everyone willingly works overtime, productivity soars and for one brief, glorious season, every belly is full. The animals' Seven Commandment credo is painted in big white letters on the barn. All animals are equal. No animal shall drink alcohol, wear clothes, sleep in a bed or kill a fellow four-footed creature. Those that go upon four legs or wings are friends and the two-legged are, by definition, the enemy. Too soon, however, the pigs, who have styled themselves leaders by virtue of their intelligence, succumb to the temptations of privilege and power. "We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of the farm depend on us. Day and night, we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples." While this swinish brotherhood sells out the revolution, cynically editing the Seven Commandments to excuse their violence and greed, the common animals are once again left hungry and exhausted, no better off than in the days when humans ran the farm. Satire <i>Animal Farm</i> may be, but it's a stony reader who remains unmoved when the stalwart workhorse, Boxer, having given his all to his comrades, is sold to the glue factory to buy booze for the pigs. Orwell's view of Communism is bleak indeed, but given the history of the Russian people since 1917, his pessimism has an air of prophecy. --<i>Joyce Thompson</i></p><h2>Principles of Corporate Finance with S&amp;P bind-in card</h2><p><i>Principles of Corporate Finance</i> is the worldwide leading text that describes the theory and practice of corporate finance.

The evening was mild. The air, misted with the memory of rain, smelled of catalpa and breeze. Paths through the grounds at Chestnut Lodge were deep in shade, the broad-brimmed trees thick with birds and leaves. A family-owned asylum in the Maryland countryside, the Lodge was often mistaken for a country estate. No fences or gates enclosed the sweeping grounds, but patients did not try to leave. Those not on locked wards walked aimlessly along the paths, watching offices in the main building flare to light in the sudden dusk. It was the first evening in weeks that no one needed seclusion or restraint, and the hallways echoed with the sound of nurses unclenching their teeth.</p> <p>From the heavily screened porches at the south end of each floor, a white clapboard cottage was visible just across the path. A lamp at its side window illumined a figure at the desk. Frieda Fromm-Reichmann sat heavily in an old leather chair, a half-smoked Chesterfield in one hand, black coffee in the other, drafts of the book she was struggling to finish scattered like leaves across her desk. In less than a month, she would be fifty-nine. It had been thirteen years since she had come to work at the Lodge, and on nights like this, she could imagine herself still in Heidelberg. War and the ironies of psychoanalytic history had made her -- a woman, a Jew, a refugee -- the most distinguished member of Chestnut Lodge's staff, but no American questioned her place. For three decades, she had chosen to work primarily in hospital settings and with the most disturbed patients. She still spent hours each week with people considered beyond reach by most psychiatrists, although seniority now permitted her to treat only those who particularly interested her. For the first time in six months, she had taken on a new patient, a young woman who was, at that moment, sitting silently on a locked ward pretending not to be terrified, unable to imagine the relationship that would transform her life.</p> <p>At sixteen, Joanne Greenberg was one of the youngest patients ever admitted to the Lodge. Her diagnosis of schizophrenia did not distinguish her from most others; every mental hospital in America was filled with schizophrenics in the late 1940s. She had been seriously disturbed since the age of nine. Her behavior had the oddness we find so unsettling in mental patients -- an embarrassing attentiveness to rules unknown to anyone else. Having finally become too strange to stay in school, she had been sent for an indeterminate stay at Chestnut Lodge.</p> <p>There was little pattern to the strangeness, which frightened Greenberg's parents as much as the symptoms themselves. The pieces didn't seem to fit together. She refused to let anyone stand behind her, making for a slinking walk and a suspicious air. She claimed to smell odors and heard whispering from people who weren't there. She spoke aloud to them sometimes, in a language no one could recognize. She ate bits of paint or wood, pieces of string, movie tickets, unprepared gelatin. Lightning petrified her. Sudden stomach pains made her double over in agony, but doctors could find no physical cause for the attacks. The plodding gait and stringy hair gave her a dull awkwardness, which seemed at odds with the biting sarcasm that took the place of ordinary talk. There was no family history of mental illness, no obvious trauma in childhood. Yet when people met Joanne Greenberg, they knew something was terribly wrong with her, even though the look on her face made them want to leave before they found out what it was.</p> <p>Hidden behind the flatness, however, were unmistakable sparks of someone still present. These were rare in a schizophrenic, except in one still a teenager. Psychosis is unrelenting anguish, a torment beyond most people's endurance, and those who end up as mental patients instead of suicides have found a way to blunt the edge. They pay a high price for this. As the lattice of lies, woven more and more tightly, blocks out the light, defenses turn parasitic, destroy the few remaining healthy parts, and then there is no way out.</p> <p>Joanne Greenberg was too young to have reached that burned-out stage, but she was well on her way. Her absent stare had the look of someone "being beaten to death from the inside." What made her different from a typical schizophrenic was that the battle was still taking place. Trickles of feeling seeped through the brittleness and appeared as expressions on her face. Her indifference had a studied quality, as if she weren't quite sure of it herself. People had yet to become interchangeable objects in her mind.</p> <p>Frieda Fromm-Reichmann had built her reputation on the claim that no patient, however disturbed, was beyond the reach of psychotherapy. Even as a medical student, listening to wildly hallucinating patients as they screamed or raved, or sitting quietly by the beds of those who lay mute and unresponsive for days, she had been convinced that buried inside the avalanche of illness was a terrified person crying out for help. Her job was to do whatever was necessary to get that person out. She did not think of this as heroic or even particularly worthy of note; a physician's responsibility was to help patients, and she had chosen to do that work.</p> <p>Frieda -- almost everyone, even some patients, called her by her first name and it would be odd to refer to her in any other way -- was legendary for her ability to gain the trust of even the most disturbed patient. But even she acknowledged that psychotherapy can work only if a person can stay present to the panic, at least a moment at a time. There has to be a tiny part of the mind that can separate itself from the terror long enough to see what it looks like. People who have reached the point of psychosis usually can't tolerate this; it feels too much like being in a collapsed mineshaft, told to crawl straight toward the danger just to see how bad it is. Literally paralyzed from years of fear, they choose the lesser evil, retreating to a place no one can reach.</p> <p>Joanne Greenberg didn't end up like this. She began treatment with Frieda a week after arriving at Chestnut Lodge. Four years later, she was successfully attending college at nearby American University. Despite months on the disturbed ward, ripping her arms to shreds with jagged tin cans and crushing lighted cigarettes into the wounds, Greenberg made a recovery so complete she was able to marry, have children, and become an accomplished writer of novels and short stories.</p> <p>It was highly unusual for a schizophrenic patient to recover at all, and the fact that Greenberg had been treated solely with psychotherapy -- no drugs, shock, or any other biological methods -- made her cure even more remarkable. But few people outside Chestnut Lodge knew of these events or would have believed them if they had. Frieda presented the case in disguised form in her book, <i>Principles of Intensive Psychotherapy,</i> and in various lectures to professional groups, but it was one among many clinical illustrations she used in the early 1950s, and she called no special attention to it. The successful outcome was satisfying to be sure, but it was also perplexing, and Frieda, always given to understatement, didn't endow it with any of the dramatic qualities it would later come to have.</p> <p>In 1964, Greenberg published a "novel," <i>I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,</i> which presented a thinly fictionalized account of her illness, treatment, and cure. Frieda was dead by that point. Joanne used a pseudonym ("Hannah Green") to protect her family, but neither that detail nor the fact that the story portrayed real events was anywhere evident in the book. To the considerable surprise of Greenberg and her publisher, <i>Rose Garden</i> gained a huge following and has been continuously in print for thirty-five years. It has sold 5.7 million copies, been translated into a dozen languages, and been transmuted into a movie, a pop song, and a cultural clich�.</p> <p>Mental patients hailed <i>Rose Garden,</i> psychiatrists denounced it, and it became the lightning rod for controversy about schizophrenia and its treatment. Eventually Joanne's and Frieda's identities were revealed, and they became one of those couples -- like Freud and Dora, Breuer and Anna O., or Ferenczi and R.N. -- that psychoanalysts revere like martyred saints.</p> <p>Their story posed two fundamental questions, questions we still cannot answer today: Can relationship heal severe mental illness? and Why are psychiatrists the people fighting hardest against this idea?</p> <p>Frieda Fromm-Reichmann would have been astonished by the adoring attitude that Greenberg's readers have taken toward her fictional incarnation, "Dr. Fried." She never saw herself as having special gifts as a therapist; she attributed her success with patients to commitment and diligence. Frieda always told people she had been a psychiatrist since earliest childhood. The eldest of three daughters in an Orthodox Jewish home, she had taken on responsibility for illusions of family harmony and was brilliant in the role. Like a simultaneous translator, listening past words to murmur, to the half glance, the tonality of a room, she interpreted everything everybody did with a grace that seemed effortless. Even as a toddler, she could execute this <i>pas de trois</i> so perfectly that neither of her parents knew she was doing it, and her vigilance transformed a thousand potentially incendiary moments into minor misunderstandings. Gliding back and forth between the sensitivities of her father and her mother's fierce control, Frieda learned to intuit a person's need the way dogs sense danger -- with her whole body. Her own neediness went unnoticed, a sacrifice so complete it seemed deliberate.</p> <p>From her earliest days as a psychiatrist, long before she had ever heard of Freud, Frieda had insisted that no matter how bizarre a patient's behavior, it had an unconscious meaning that could potentially be deciphered. This m...</p></p><h2>Morning Milking</h2><p>A young girl who spends her mornings helping her father milk the cows in the barn tries to stop time so that she can hold onto each vivid moment</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 4-- This handsome, oversized picture book portrays an early morning on the dairy farm in northern Maryland on which Morris grew up. She presents herself as a small child, only seven or eight from the look of the paintings, as she helps her father milk the cows. She savors the smells, sounds, and activities and describes them to readers. The account is so filled with detail that although this is a memory piece for adults, it will also be very immediate for children. Although it may seem unlikely that a young child would have such a sense of poignancy about the passage of time, the author uses the device beautifully. DeRan is equally adept at lovingly depicting life on the farm. His watercolor paintings are spacious and handsome, and the visual images are as idealized as the text. The proportions of the architecture are expansive and seem perfect, beginning with the stately, uncurtained windows in the child's bedroom through which readers see a low crescent moon and a sprinkle of stars. The human figures are generalized, with averted faces so they can fit the memories of any reader. The colors, in earth tones, and the realistic style make one think of an understated, self-effacing Andrew Wyeth or Barry Moser. For everyone with a loving memory of a visit to a dairy farm, and for anyone who never had the chance, this book conveys its rhythms and textures. --Marilyn Iarusso, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Nonprofit Organizations: Theory, Management, Policy</h2><p><p>This text is the first to dedicate itself to the nonprofit sector.

It combines cutting-edge research on groups with practical management principles. The text is organized into 3 primary tasks for the leader/manager: 1) Accurately assessing and improving team performance; 2) Managing the internal dynamics of teams (diversity, conflict, and creativity); and 3) Optimally leveraging the team within the larger organization. It is written for both team leaders and team members.</p><p></p><h2>Self and Others: Object Relations Theory in Practice</h2><p><i>Self and Others</i> is addressed to students and practitioners of psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Its 19 chapters are divided into five evenly balanced parts. The first rubric, "Self, Others, and Ego," introduces us to the units of the intersubjective constitution we have come to know as object relations theory. The second rubric, "Developing Object Relations," is a confluence of lessons derived from infant studies and the psychotherapeutic process, specifically from the work of Mahler and Kernberg. Third, Hamilton integrates into an "Object Relations Continuum" Mahler's developmental stages and organizational series with nosological entities and levels of personality organization. Under the penultimate rubric, "Treatment," levels of object relatedness and types of psychopathology are grounded in considerations of technique in treatment, and generous clinical vignettes are provided to illustrate the technical issues cited. Last, the rubric of "Broader Contexts" takes object relations theory out of the consulting room into application areas that include folklore, myth, and transformative themes on the self, small and large groups, applications of object relations theory outside psychoanalysis, and the evolutionary history and politics of object relations theory. <br><br>This volume thus presents an integrative theory of object relations that links theory with practice. But, more than that, Hamilton accomplishes his objective of delineating an integrative theory that is quite free of rivalry between schools of thought. <br><br>An indispensable contribution to beginning psychoanalytic candidates and other practitioners as well as those who wish to see the application of object relations theories to fields outside of psychoanalysis.<br><br>&#x2015;<i>Psychoanalytic Books: A Quarterly Journal of Reviews</i><br><br><i>A Jason Aronson Book</i></p><p>This book best approximates what every psychiatric resident, clinical psychologist, psychiatric social worker, and analytic institute candidate would have wished for. It is an extraordinary handbook of the new developmental psychologies of psychoanalysis. (James S. Grotstein, M.D.)<br><br>Dr. Hamilton has provided us with a text that is at once comprehensive, sophisticated, clinically relevant, and perfectly understandable to the budding professional. The author breathes life into the theory with his liberal use of clearly written clinical vignettes and literary references. Moreover, Hamilton is blessed with a touch of the poet, which makes his prose a supreme pleasure to read. This is a superb achievement that deserves a place on the shelves of psychiatric residents and other trainees in the mental health disciplines. (Glen O.

The poetry of his formative years includes the haunting elegy to his young sister and the grieving lyric at the death of his father. The religious drama of his romance with Rome is captured here, as well as its resolution in his renewed love of ancient Greece. He explores forbidden sexual desires, pays homage to the great theatre stars and poets of his day, observes cityscapes with impressionist intensity. His final masterpiece, The Ballad of Reading Gaol, tells the painful story of his own prison experience and calls for universal compassion. This edition of Wilde&#39;s verse presents the full range of his achievement as a poet.</p><p>Oscar Wilde was born on October 16, 1854, to the Irish nationalist and writer Speranza Wilde and the doctor William Wilde. After graduating from Oxford in 1878, Wilde moved to London, where he became notorious for his sharp wit and flamboyant style of dress. <br><br>Though he was publishing plays and poems throughout the 1880s, it wasn't until the late 1880s and early 1890s that his work started to be received positively. In 1895, Oscar Wilde was tried for homosexuality and was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. Tragically, this downfall came at the height of his career, as his plays, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, were playing to full houses in London. He was greatly weakened by the privations of prison life, and moved to Paris after his sentence. Wilde died in a hotel room, either of syphilis or complications from ear surgery, in Paris, on November 30, 1900.</p><h2>Grandmaster Secrets: Openings</h2><p>Using a Socratic teacher-student approach in the characters of GM Noah Tall, and Pat Sayre, the topic of this aspect of chess centers around the subjects of materialism, give and take, myths, difficulties, picking and choosing, rules, decisions, de-booking, and many more&#x2014;dealt with from a veteran chess grandmaster's perspective. <p>An illustrative way is used so that everyone can grasp the concepts quickly; to improve in a shorter amount of time.

Cather's remark describes her own powerfully imaginative recreation of the Nebraska frontier of her youth.

In her absence, Green has constructed an elliptical arrangement of artifacts from an untold life. In this rescued history, Green imagines for her aunt a childhood in which she is bold, reckless, perspicacious, mischievous; an adolescence ripe with desire and scarred by violation and loss; and an adulthood in which she strives to sing above the incessant din of violence.</p><p>Constance&#x2015;one half of a sister duo put to work performing as musical prodigies in the dirt-poor town of Oil City, Pennsylvania. during the Great Depression&#x2015;escapes as a teenager to the USO and tours a ravaged Italy during World War II. Soon after she returns to an unsparing life in New York City, she disappears. Green traces her dissolution in a deftly composed trove of letters Constance writes to her beloved sister and those she receives from dozens of men smitten by her stage persona, along with her drawings, collages and altered photographs.</p><p>Though told mostly from Constance's point of view, <i>Frail Sister</i> is also haunted by the voices of the transient, the absent and the dead. The letters (a few real, many invented) expose not only the quotidian reality of war but also the ubiquitous brutality it throws into relief.</p><p>Nimble, darkly funny and poignant, <i>Frail Sister</i> is possessed by the disappeared, giving voice to the voiceless, bringing into a focus a life disintegrating at every edge.</p></p><p>An ambitious collage attempting to place the reader within an imagined consciousness&#x2015;typically the provenance of prose literature.

(Ryan Chapman <i>The Believer</i>)<br><br>Frail Sister is not simply a graphic narrative made up of a compelling art form &#x2015; it is a song, a dirge, a mystery, and a tragic lark. (Elaine Sexton <i>On the Seawall</i>)<br><br>[Green] is honoring the lives of so many other lost and forgotten women. (Elissa Schappell <i>Tin House</i>)<br><br>Those artifacts are both found and made&#x2015;we readers mostly don&#x2019;t know which&#x2015;and are all over each other in every manner of letter, photograph, clipping, drawing, and diagram, making the book like a biographical archive ordered by chronology and collaged into lucid disorder.

From the beginning to the end of the book, we bear witness to a life, too-short but fully-lived. This is simply fascinating and gorgeously written, gorgeously assembled. (Roxane Gay <i>Goodreads/Twitter</i>)<br><br>Glorious, a haunting prism of art and artifact, Frail Sister builds its power as a mystery does, with clues and secrets, the story inseparable from the form. Moving, sly and skillful, a portrait of woman&#x2019;s life in the embodied history of its materials. A marvel. (Janet Fitch)<br><br>Karen Green smashes the boundaries between the visual and the written, the found and the invented, the comic and the tragic; between uncompromising art and pure fun. Her ear is as keen as her eye is dazzling. And her obsessions are contagious. (Jonathan Franzen)<br><br>Frail Sister is a singular achievement that defies genre naming. Here image is formed by epistolary text which is informed by the unformed facts of actual lives reformed by fiction. Sisters in life and the men who admire, cajole or destroy them stand in for every woman who has felt missing, gone missing, found dead. If there must be a question at the center of every breath, Frail Sister asks what it is to &#x201c;faint upwards&#x201d; or &#x201c;float and fall&#x201d; in the same moment. This is a masterwork creating its own terms for existence&#x2015;every page a marvelous and terrifying journey.

He does well in school and interacts well with other children, although he prefers playing with children who are slightly younger than he is. Jason's parents have been divorced for two years, but he is close to both of them. Lately he has been given to fits of explosive anger. He is unresponsive to attempts at discipline by either his mother or his teacher. He often seems to withdraw into himself. Recently, he and another boy were arrested for starting a trash fire. Jason was referred to treatment by Child Protective Services following a report to CPS from Jason's teacher that there was reason to believe that his mother was physically abusing him. Based on these and other details provided in "The Case of Jason L."&#x2014;including objective and projective test results&#x2014;how would you characterize Jason's problem, and how would you apply your particular brand of play therapy in a clinical intervention with Jason? This, in essence, was the question Kevin O'Connor and Lisa Mages Braverman posed to notable play therapists from across North America. The chapters in this book record their detailed responses. In each chapter, an author (or authors) describes a particular theoretical model of play therapy and explains how he or she would apply it to Jason's case.

Lee on 21 March 1862, and from then until the surrender, he stood at the general&#x2019;s side. A military secretary, he compiled a remarkable, intimate account of the day-to-day wartime experience of the Confederacy&#x2019;s most celebrated--and enigmatic--military figure.<p>Marshall&#x2019;s papers are of three sorts: those intended for a projected life of Lee, those intended for an account of the campaign at Gettysburg, and notes on events of the war. Collected here, these papers provide a unique firsthand look at Lee&#x2019;s generalship&#x2014;from the most complete account ever given of the fateful orders issued to Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg, to the only testimony from a Southern witness of the scene in McLean&#x2019;s house at Appomattox.</p><p>Marshall&#x2019;s commentary addresses some of the war&#x2019;s more intriguing questions: Whose idea was it to fight the second Manassas? What caused Jackson&#x2019;s delays in the Battles of the Seven Days? Who devised the flank march around Hooker at Chancellorsville? This book&#x2019;s insights into Robert E. Lee and his military strategy and its close-up report on the Confederacy&#x2019;s war qualify it as an indispensable part of America&#x2019;s historical record.</p></p><p>Frederick Maurice was a British army officer and author who had a particular interest in the American Civil War.

The <i>Dictionary for Children</i> is sensible, well designed, and illustrated with plenty of pictures. Each letter gets a mini-exploration of its role in sounds and spelling; for example, "<b>B</b> has only one sound in English, as in <b>b</b>ad and <b>b</b>oth, but it is sometimes doubled as in ra<b>bb</b>it. The letter <b>B</b> is also silent in some words such as clim<b>b</b>, com<b>b</b>, or plum<b>b</b>er." Definitions are clear but not oversimplified, and homonyms are identified so that spellers won't be confused: words that sound like flue "are <b>flew</b> and <b>flu</b>." The type is large enough to be readable, and the tone is serious but not pretentious. The <i>MacMillan Dictionary for Children</i> has long been a favorite with kids, and this version, revised for the 21st century, is even better than previous editions.Grade 3-8. Modeled closely after the 1989 edition, this revised dictionary contains 35,000 entries with well-placed, full-color photographs and illustrations on almost every page. Many timely words have been added?karaoke, Velcro, Internet, online, alimony, rap (music), and telecommunications?but not modem or clone. When there are multiple meanings, each is numbered. Illustrative sentences often follow definitions. The syllabication, pronunciation, plural, and parts of speech round out each entry. Homophones are listed; for selected words, examples of synonyms are used in sentences. Word histories are given for interesting cases and are set off by red bars. Green bars indicate language-usage notes, explaining words such as ain't, among, capital/capitol, real/really, emigrate/immigrate. Spelling tips are offered at the beginning of each letter section. An excellent usage guide, an extensive history of the English language, and a pronunciation key are provided. A final reference section contains portraits and brief facts about the presidents, flags with brief statistics about the countries they represent, several maps, and weights and measure conversion charts. This version updates the presidential information and expands the flag section but does not include a time line. Attractive and easy to use, this new edition has retained the best of its predecessor and has modernized its look and contents.?Priscilla Bennett, State University of West Georgia, Carrollton<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Psycholinguistics: The Key Concepts (Routledge Key Guides)</h2><p><p><em>Psycholinguistics</em> is an authoritative, wide-ranging and up-to-date A to Z guide to this important field.

With a New Preface by the Authors: What It Takes to Be an Authentic Leader</h2><p><p><b>Are <i>you</i> an authentic leader?</b> Too many companies are managed not by leaders but by mere role players and faceless bureaucrats. What would it take to replace these empty suits with real leaders--men and women who are confident in who they are and what they stand for and who truly inspire people to achieve extraordinary results? Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones argue that leaders don't become great by aspiring to a list of universal character traits. Rather, effective leaders are authentic: they deploy individual strengths to engage followers' hearts, minds, and souls. Authentic leaders are skillful at consistently being themselves, even as they alter their behavior to respond effectively to changing contexts. In short, the authors present a powerful case: that it takes "being yourself, in context, with skill" to be a successful, authentic leader--and they show you how to do exactly that. In this lively and practical book, Goffee and Jones draw from extensive research to reveal how to hone and deploy your unique leadership assets while managing the inherent tensions at the heart of successful leadership: when to show emotion and when to withhold it, how to get close to followers while maintaining an appropriate role distance, and maintaining your individuality while "conforming enough" to gain traction and lead change. Underscoring the inherently social nature of leadership, the book also explores how leaders can stay attuned to the needs and expectations of followers. <i>Why Should Anyone Be Led by You?</i> will forever change how we view, develop, and practice the art of leadership, wherever we live and work.</p></p><p><p><b>Rob Goffee</b> is Emeritus Professor of Organisational Behaviour at London Business School.

This is what I've always thought it meant to be a writer. Writing, knowing in part that no matter how trivial your words may seem, someday, somewhere, someone may risk his or her life to read them."--<i>Create Dangerously</i></p><p> In this deeply personal book, the celebrated Haitian-American writer Edwidge Danticat reflects on art and exile, examining what it means to be an immigrant artist from a country in crisis. Inspired by Albert Camus' lecture, "Create Dangerously," and combining memoir and essay, Danticat tells the stories of artists, including herself, who create despite, or because of, the horrors that drove them from their homelands and that continue to haunt them. Danticat eulogizes an aunt who guarded her family's homestead in the Haitian countryside, a cousin who died of AIDS while living in Miami as an undocumented alien, and a renowned Haitian radio journalist whose political assassination shocked the world. Danticat writes about the Haitian novelists she first read as a girl at the Brooklyn Public Library, a woman mutilated in a machete attack who became a public witness against torture, and the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat and other artists of Haitian descent. Danticat also suggests that the aftermaths of natural disasters in Haiti and the United States reveal that the countries are not as different as many Americans might like to believe.</p><p><i>Create Dangerously</i> is an eloquent and moving expression of Danticat's belief that immigrant artists are obliged to bear witness when their countries of origin are suffering from violence, oppression, poverty, and tragedy.</p></p><p><p>"This is the most powerful book I've read in years. Though delicate in its prose and civil in its tone, it hits like a freight train. It's a call to arms for all immigrants, all artists, all those who choose to bear witness, and all those who choose to listen. And though it describes great upheaval, tragedy, and injustice, it's full of humor, warmth, grace, and light."<b>--Dave Eggers, author of <i>Zeitoun</i> and <i>What Is the What</i></b></p><p>"Edwidge Danticat is a great literary artist. She is also a grand cultural critic whose wisdom and compassion loom large in this magnificent book."<b>--Cornel West, Princeton University</b></p><p>"Edwidge Danticat's prose has a Chekhovian simplicity--an ability to state the most urgent truths in a measured and patiently plain style that gathers a luminous energy as it moves inexorably forward. In this book she makes a strong case that art, for immigrants from countries where human rights and even survival are often in jeopardy, must be a vocation to witness if it is not to be an idle luxury."<b>--Madison Smartt Bell, author of <i>Toussaint Louverture: A Biography</i></b></p><p><i>Create Dangerously</i> is an intelligent and passionate book on the role of the immigrant artist. As in her fiction, the lucidity and humility of Edwidge Danticat's prose has a quiet force.

While many have wondered who she "really" is, trying to cut through the persona she projects and the one projected by the media, Beail and Longworth analyze why she touches such a nerve with the American electorate. Why does she ignite such passionate loyalty &#x2013; and such loathing? How did her candidacy mobilize new parts of the electorate? </p> <p></p> <p>Using the notion of "framing" as a way of understanding political perception, the authors analyze the narratives told by and about Sarah Palin in the 2008 election &#x2013; from beauty queen, maverick, faithful fundamentalist and post-feminist role model to pit bull hockey mom, frontier woman, and political outsider. They discuss where those frames are rooted historically in popular and political culture, why they were selected, and the ways that the frames resonated with the electorate. </p> <p></p> <p><em>Framing Sarah Palin</em> addresses the question of what the choice and perception of these frames tells us about the state of American politics, and about the status of American women in politics in particular.

Ahad Ha'am ("One of the People") was the pen name of Asher Ginzberg (1856-1927), a Russian Jew whose life intersected nearly every important trend and current in contemporary Jewry. A Hebrew essayist of extraordinary knowledge and skill, he exerted a rare, perhaps unequalled, authority through his writings on every controversial issue from Jewish nationalism and clericalism to the Palestinian Arab problem.<br><br>Steven Zipperstein offers all those interested in Israel and modern Jewish history a wide-ranging, perceptive reassessment of Ahad Ha'am's life against the backdrop of his contentious political world. This influential figure comes to life in a penetrating and engaging examination of his relations with his father, with Zionist leader Theodor Herzl, and with his devotees and opponents alike.</p><p>"A brilliant treatment of the major intellectual leader of Zionism. . . . The book is written in an uncommonly lucid, even graceful style [and] investigates the history of modern Jewry with unprecedented depth and insight."&#x2014;Arnold Band, University of California, Los Angeles<br><br>"I am very grateful for Steven Zipperstein's book about Ahad Ha'am. I have learned a great deal from its historical scholarship and intellectual lucidity."&#x2014;Irving Howe, author of <i>World of Our Fathers</i><br><br>"Zipperstein, already well known as the historian of the Jews of Odessa, has now written a thoroughly erudite but deeply personal biography of one their greatest sons. . . . This first-rate study of his life and work makes for absorbing reading, with an all too contemporary relevance."&#x2014;Joseph Frank, Stanford University&#34;A brilliant treatment of the major intellectual leader of Zionism. . . .

The species that survive will be the ones that are most compatible with us: the weedy species&#x2015;from mosquitoes to coyotes&#x2015;that thrive in continually disturbed human-dominated environments. <i>The End of the Wild</i> is a wake-up call. Marshaling evidence from the last ten years of research on the environment, Stephen Meyer argues that nothing&#x2015;not national or international laws, global bioreserves, local sustainability schemes, or "wildlands"&#x2015;will change the course that has been set. Like it or not, we can no longer talk about conserving nature, only managing what is left. The race to save biodiversity is over.</p><p>But that doesn't mean our work is over. <i>The End of the Wild</i> is also a call to action. Without intervention, the surviving ecosystems we depend on for a range of services&#x2015;including water purification and flood and storm damage contro&#x2015;could fail and the global spread of invasive species (pests, parasites, and disease-causing weedy species) could explode. If humanity is to survive, Meyer argues, we have no choice but to try to manage the fine details. We must move away from the current haphazard strategy of protecting species in isolation and create trans-regional "meta-reserves," designed to protect ecosystem functions rather than species-specific habitats.</p></p><p>The late Stephen M. Meyer was a professor of Political Science at MIT. In 2005 he was awarded the Francis W. Sargent Conservation Award by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.Meyer presents a to-the-point, X-ray-explicit diagnosis of the state of the biosphere, and the prognosis is not good. So pervasive is humankind, he argues, instead of natural selection we now have human selection. Other species must adapt to our climate-changing presence, as have the common rat and the white-tailed deer, or face extinction. Hundreds of thousands of organisms, including such splendid animals as the African elephant and the giant panda, have become "relic species" as they struggle to maintain their foothold in environments radically altered by human development. The species we choose to protect for economic or aesthetic reasons are relegated to "boutique populations" in bioreserves, which are, in truth, the "-antithesis of the wild." Meyer outlines the human-spun "web of threats" to biodiversity and warns not of an end of life but of biodiversity, resulting in "a peculiarly homogenized assemblage" of human-adapted organisms. Brisk and shocking, Meyer's grim vision is a snap to attention. We must acquire an ecological perspective if we hope to save any remnant of life's many--splendored bounty. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It is the first full-length study to explore the link between a western theatre which, says Kershaw, is largely outdated and the blossoming of postmodern performance, much of which has a genuinely radical edge. In staying focused on the period between Brecht and Baudrillard, modernity and postmodernism, Baz Kershaw identifies crucial resources for the revitalisation of the radical across a wide spectrum of cultural practices.<br> This is a timely, necessary and rigorous book. It will be a compelling read for anyone searching for a critical catalyst for new ways of viewing and practising cultural politics.</p><p>Baz Kershaw teaches at the University of Bristol, and is the author of <i>The Politics of Performance</i> (Routledge, 1992).Kershaw's project is complex and broad-ranging..<br><b>&#x2013;<i>Research in Drama Education</i>, 2001</b><br><br>...this serves as a useful synthesis of contemporary cultural theory and its modernist, and post-structuralist, antecedents..<br><b>&#x2013;<i>Research in Drama Education</i>, 2001</b><br><br>This is a charged, interesting book.

Out of this invitation emerges a fascinating and broadening investigation of how contemporary psychoanalysis can "mind" spirituality in the threefold sense of being bothered by it, of attending to it, and of cultivating it. <br><br>Both the questions Sorenson asks, and the answers he begins to formulate, reflect progressive changes in the psychoanalytic understanding of spirituality.&nbsp; Sorenson begins by quantitatively analyzing 75 years of journal literature and documenting how psychoanalytic approaches to religious and spiritual experiences have evolved far beyond the "wholesale pathologizing of religion" prevalent during Freud's lifetime. Then, in successive chapters, he explores and illustrates the kind of clinical technique appropriate to the modern treatment of religious issues. And the issue of technique is consequential in more than one way -- Sorenson presents evidence that how analysts work clinically has a greater impact on their patients' spirituality than the patients' own parents have. <br><br>Sorenson brings an array of disciplinary perspectives to bear in examining the multiple relationships among psychoanalysis, religion, and spirituality. Empirical analysis, psychoanalytic history, sociology of religion, comparative theory, and sustained clinical interpretation all enter into his effort to open a dialogue that is clinically relevant. Turning traditional critiques of psychoanalytic training on their head, he argues that psychoanalytic education has much to learn from models of contemporary theological education.&nbsp; Beautifully crafted and engagingly written, <em>Minding Spirituality</em> not only invites interdisciplinary dialogue but, via Sorenson's wide-ranging and passionately open-minded scholarship, exemplifies it.</p><p>Sorenson brings an array of disciplinary perspectives to bear in examining the multiple relationships among psychoanalysis, religion, and spirituality.

Turning traditional critiques of psychoanalytic training on their head, he argues that psychoanalytic education has much to learn from models of contemporary theological education. "Are psychoanalysis and religion in the same business?" he asks in his concluding chapter. No, he answers, but for reasons very different from those adduced by analysts and theologians of the past. In fact, he holds, the new criteria of demarcation offer rich opportunities for dialogue among psychoanalysis, religion, and spirituality.

Born in Warsaw, he studied at the universities of Warsaw, Paris, and Lodz. Kott returned to Poland shortly before World War II and was drafted into the Polish army. Later he took part in the underground resistance against the Nazi occupation. After teaching Polish literary history at the University of Warsaw and being a visiting professor at Yale, Kott lost his Warsaw post on political grounds. He was granted asylum in the United States in 1969, by which time he had become known in Europe for his writings about Shakespeare.

Brewer, Fourth Edition, with Maps</h2><p>In 1860 William Brewer, a young Yale-educated teacher of the natural sciences and a recent widower, eagerly accepted an offer from Josiah Whitney to assist in the first geological survey of the state of California. Brewer was not a geologist, but his training in agriculture and botany made him an invaluable member of the team.

Published in 1987, to huge acclaim, it immediately took its place as the indispensable guide to the mysteries - and idiosyncracies - of the human mind. In no other book can the reader find discussions of concepts such as language, memory, and intelligence, side by side with witty definitions of common human experiences such as the 'cocktail-party' and 'halo' effects, and the least effort principle. <br><br>Richard Gregory again brings his wit, wisdom, and expertise to bear on this most elusive of subjects. Research into the mind and brain has moved on in bounds in recent years, and interest in the subject has never been so high. There has been a shift in focus away from Freud's concept of the unconscious onto consciousness itself. The new edition of the <em>Companion</em> includes three 'mini symposia' - on consciousness, brain scanning, and artificial intelligence - with contributions from a number of specialists, and encompassing a range of approaches. <br><br>Cultural as well as scientific in approach, this accessible book offers authoritative descriptions and analysis. With new entries on controversial topics such as artificial life, attachment theory, caffeine, cruetly, drama, extra-terrestrial intelligence, genetics of mental illness, imagination, lying, puzzles, and twins, this highly-anticipated second edition explores the most intriguing of subjects.<br></p><p>A field of 216 contributors filled this tome with savory items from Abacus to Zeno of Elea.

It has been further argued, particularly since the early 1970s, that sexual drives and desires also condition the distribution, display and reception of art.</p><p>This anthology traces how and why this identification of art with sexual expression or repression arose and how the terms have shifted in tandem with artistic and theoretical debates, from the era of the rights movements to the present. Among the subjects it discusses are abjection and the &#x201c;informe,&#x201d; or formless; pornography and the obscene; the performativity of gender and sexuality; and the role of sexuality in forging radical art or curatorial practices in response to such issues as state-sponsored repression and anti-feminism in the broader social realm.</p><p><b>Artists surveyed include<br></b>Vito Acconci, Assume Vivid Astro Focus, Lynda Benglis, Louise Bourgeois, Gerard Byrne, George Chakravarthi, Judy Chicago, Vaginal Davis, Wim Delvoye, Elmgreen &amp; Dragset, Valie Export, F�lix Gonz�lez-Torres, Guillermo G�mez-Pe�a, Harmony Hammond, Claudette Johnson, Mary Kelly, Yayoi Kusama, Robert Legorreta, Paul McCarthy, Sarah Maple, Shirin Neshat, Lorraine O'Grady, Yoko Ono, Catherine Opie, Orlan, William Pope.L, Miriam Schapiro, Carolee Schneemann, Joan Semmel, Barbara Smith, Annie Sprinkle, Alina Szapocznikow, Del LaGrace Volcano, Hannah Wilke, David Wojnarowicz</p><p><b>Writers include<br></b>Malek Alloula, Norman O.

The result is a contemporary spiritual guide for your personal religious life.</p><p>According to the Hebrew Bible, God made the world with words. God just spoke and the world came into being.

According to this belief, Kushner proceeds to meditate and play with spiritually charged words such as "Love," "Water," and some surprising choices such as "Garbage." Each short essay ends with a <i>kavanah</i>, or meditative exercise, designed to "help the reader 'live in the word.'"

It offers a life in letters that showcases his many struggles as well as his memorable achievements. Arranged by decade and linked by expert commentary, the volume guides us through Hughes&#x2019;s journey in all its aspects: personal, political, practical, and&#x2014;above all&#x2014;literary. His letters range from those written to family members, notably his father (who opposed Langston&#x2019;s literary ambitions), and to friends, fellow artists, critics, and readers who sought him out by mail. These figures include personalities such as Carl Van Vechten, Blanche Knopf, Zora Neale Hurston, Arna Bontemps, Vachel Lindsay, Ezra Pound, Richard Wright, Kurt Weill, Carl Sandburg, Gwendolyn Brooks, James Baldwin, Martin Luther King, Jr., Alice Walker, Amiri Baraka, and Muhammad Ali. The letters tell the story of a determined poet precociously finding his mature voice; struggling to realize his literary goals in an environment generally hostile to blacks; reaching out bravely to the young and challenging them to aspire beyond the bonds of segregation; using his artistic prestige to serve the disenfranchised and the cause of social justice; irrepressibly laughing at the world despite its quirks and humiliations. Venturing bravely on what he called the &#x201c;big sea&#x201d; of life, Hughes made his way forward always aware that his only hope of self-fulfillment and a sense of personal integrity lay in diligently pursuing his literary vocation. Hughes&#x2019;s voice in these pages, enhanced by photographs and quotations from his poetry, allows us to know him intimately and gives us an unusually rich picture of this generous, visionary, gratifyingly good man who was also a genius of modern American letters.</p></p><p><p><b>ARNOLD RAMPERSAD</b>, the Sarah Hart Kimball Professor Emeritus in the Humanities at Stanford University, has also taught at Princeton, Columbia, and Rutgers Universities.

I must feel that I have been misusing your kindness and that it would be wrong to you for me to take your help any more when I cannot write&#x2014; when I cannot do what you believe I should be doing&#x2014; when I am afraid of making you unhappy because you have been kind good to me&#x2014; and when I know that I cannot write at all on any sort of pre- arranged schedule. The nervous strain of finishing the novel by a certain time has shown me that. Almost all of one&#x2019;s life must be measured and timed as it is&#x2014; meals every day at a certain hour; if I am working for a salary&#x2014; to work at a certain time; to bed at a certain time in order to get enough sleep; letters to be answered by a certain time in order to avoid discourtesy or loss of business. So far in this world, only my writing has been my own, to do when I wanted to do it, to finish only when I felt that it was finished, to put it aside or discard it completely if I chose. For the sake of my physical body I have washed restaurant thousands of hotel dishes, cooked, scrubbed decks, worked 12 to 15 hours a day on a farm, swallowed my pride for the sake help of philanthropy and charity&#x2014; but nobody ever said to me &#x201c;You must write now, you must finish that poem tomorrow. You must begin to create on the first of the month.&#x201d; Because then I could not have have written, I could not have created anything. I could only have put down empty words at best. . . . . . The creative urge must come from within, always as you know dear G., &#x2014; or it is less than true . . . . . So I am sorry if you feel that I have been unnecessarily idle. And, I am ashamed beyond words, if I have misused your generousity. I did not want ever to do that. And if I have misunderstood your words advice, your kind and sincere talks with me the last few weeks, blame only my stupidity, Godmother, not my heart. My love and devotion are yours always, and my deepest respect and gratitude, and my willingness always to listen to you in the future as in the past and to be guided by you as nearly as I can. But I must tell you the truth so that there will be no wall between us.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> TO ALAIN LOCKE<br><br> S.S.�West� Hassayampa, Jones Point, N.Y. February 6, 1923.<br><br> Dear Mr. Locke:<br><br> I have had your delightful letter for a long while and I have wanted to answer you sooner, but so many things have intervened, a bad cold and a birthday, &#x2014;I am twenty-one! And then I am a terrible correspondent. But I should like to know you and I hope you&#x2019;ll write to me again.<br><br> It is too bad I am not living in New York anymore.&nbsp; I am missing so many interesting people. I am chasing dreams up here, though, and that&#x2019;s an infinitely more delightful occupation even than being in New York, where all my old dreams had been realized; college, (horrible place, but I wanted to go), Broadway and the theatres &#x2014; delightful memories, Riverside Drive in the mists, and Harlem. A whirling year in New York! Now I want to go to Europe. Stay for a while in France, then live with the gypsies in Spain (wild dream, isn&#x2019;t it?) and see the bull fights in Seville. My Spanish is good from having lived in Mexico and there&#x2019;s no sport in the world as lovely as a &#x201c;corrida de toros,&#x201d; to those who like them.<br><br> Jeritza is wonderful, isn&#x2019;t she? I fell in love with her last year and waited at the stage door for a smile and a rose. But have you seen Chaliapin in &#x201c;Boris&#x201d;? If you haven&#x2019;t, please do. It&#x2019;s the experience of a lifetime. And did you see the Moscow Art players? I couldn&#x2019;t get in, so I comforted myself with seeing the &#x201c;Chauvin&nbsp; Souris&#x201d; for the third time, and&nbsp; Jane&nbsp; Cowl&#x2019;s&nbsp;&nbsp; Juliet.&nbsp; I suppose you saw Barrymore&#x2019;s Hamlet, and maybe &#x201c;Rain.&#x201d; I have been telling all my friends to see it&#x2014; &#x201c;Rain&#x201d;&#x2014; but none of them take my advice. For me, it&#x2019;s the finest thing, aside from &#x201c;Hamlet,&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve seen this season, and stands out in my mind as &#x201c;Anna Christie&#x201d; from last year&#x2019;s plays.<br><br> Countee told me about seeing the &#x201c;World We Live In&#x201d; with you. He has been doing some very beautiful poems lately, hasn&#x2019;t he?<br><br> Jones Point is about forty miles up the Hudson from New York&#x2014; a little white village almost pushed into the water by the snow�covered hills. And the Hassayampa is one of five &nbsp;&#x201c;mother� ships&#x201d; anchored in the river in a forest of masts and cables belonging to a hundred other long old sea-going boats waiting for the Subsidy to pass, or something to happen to take them back to the sea. The sailors up here are the finest fellows I&#x2019;ve ever met&#x2014;fellows you can touch and know and be friends with. And after the atmosphere of college last year, being up here on the long ships is like fresh air and night stars after three hours in a dull movie show.<br><br> No I haven&#x2019;t a single dramatic sketch. I would be glad to hear from you again and to enjoy your friendship.<br><br> Sincerely, <br> Langston Hughes<br> &nbsp;<br> Excerpted from&nbsp;<b>THE LETTERS OF LANGSTON HUGHES </b>by Langston Hughes.

As such, it has important implications for understanding the past, present, and future condition of our species. In general, scholars have emphasized either the biological or the cultural aspects of breastfeeding, but not both. As biological anthropologists the editors of this volume feel that an evolutionary approach combining both aspects is essential. One of the goals of their book is to incorporate data from diverse fields to present a more holistic view of breastfeeding, through the inclusion of research from a number of different disciplines, including biological and social/cultural anthropology, nutrition, and medicine. The resulting book, presenting the complexity of the issues surrounding very basic decisions about infant nutrition, will fill a void in the existing literature on breastfeeding.</p></p><p><p> &#x201c;This volume makes an important contribution to the literature on the biocultural nature of breastfeeding, a behavior that is critical to the survival of the human species.... [T]his collection provides a wealth of information about the interplay of culture and biology as they relate to breastfeeding and its influence on maternal and infant health. Many of the chapters have implications for the development of policy relating to the support of breastfeeding, such as the Family Leave Act and health care reform. This unique volume will thus be useful for health care professionals and health policy makers, as well as biological and cultural anthropologists.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Anne L. Wright, <em>Medical Anthropology Quarterly</em></p> <p> &#x201c;One hundred years ago, the vast majority of infants in the United States were breastfed. They were typically weaned anywhere between two and four years of age. Today the statistics are quite different. At the present time, about one-half of infants in the United States are breastfed, and most are weaned by the time they are six months old. <em>Breastfeeding: Biocultural Perspectives</em> examines the biological and cultural reasons for this shift in behavior.... This volume of fifteen chapters, by almost as many authors, provides readers with an abundance of information on breastfeeding.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Christine A.

He studied at the Institut d&#39;histoire de l&#39;art and at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes. In 1974, Lemaire, an author, historian and art critic, translator and journalist, founded the &#34;Connexions&#34; collection at the French publishers Flammarion, in addition to founding the &#34;Les derniers mots&#34; collection at the publisher Christian bourgeois, for whom he also managed the magazine L&#39;Ennemi from 1980-1996. At present, Lemaire is chief editor of the art and literature magazine Verso and is also responsible for the &#34;arts&#34; section of the cultural magazine Les Lettres francaises.</p><h2>Last Rites</h2><p><p><b>A master historian offers an eloquent and personal auto-history of his life and his ideas</b><br><br> Twenty years ago, John Lukacs paused to set down the history of his own thoughts and beliefs in <i>Confessions of an Original Sinner</i>, an adroit blend of autobiography and personal philosophy. Now, in <i>Last Rites</i>, he continues and expands his reflections, this time integrating his conception of history and human knowledge with private memories of his wives and loves, and enhancing the book with footnotes from his idiosyncratic diaries. The resulting volume is fascinating and delightful&#x2014;an auto-history by a passionate, authentic, brilliant, and witty man.</p><p>Lukacs begins with a concise rendering of a historical understanding of our world (essential reading for any historian), then follows with trenchant observations on his life in the United States, commentary on his native Hungary and the new meanings it took for him after 1989, and deeply personal portraits of his three wives, about whom he has not written before. He includes also a chapter on his formative memories of May and June 1940 and of Winston Churchill, a subject in some of Lukacs&#x2019;s later studies. <i>Last Rites </i>is a richly layered summation combined with a set of extraordinary observations&#x2014;an original book only John Lukacs could have written.</p><p>Praise for <i>Confessions of an Original Sinner</i>:<br> &#x201c;[Lukacs] is an often witty and always fascinating&#x2014;even entertaining&#x2014;writer.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Washington</i><i> Post</i></p></p><p><p>John Lukacs is an internationally read and praised historian, the author of some thirty books, a winner of numerous academic honors and awards, past president of the American Catholic Historical Association, and a member of the Royal Historical Society of the United Kingdom. He lives in Phoenixville, PA.</p>In these writings concerned with his thoughts and beliefs rather than his life per se, the great twentieth-century historian touches on two major themes of his interpretive (and imaginative) A Thread of Years (1997) and At the End of an Age (2002). One is that the modern (or, more properly, Lukacs says, the bourgeois) age is over; its great intellectual construction, liberalism, exhausted. The other, more important, is that history as knowledge is personal and participant. Objective history is impossible, Lukacs maintains, for each person, including the historian and the thinker (lofty or humble) about history, is enmeshed in human relations and has particular perspectives on events. But those philosophical convictions do not monopolize Lukacs here. Vast and public as well as personal matters, including the connections of physics and history, Lukacs&#x2019; situation as a man of two nations (Hungary and America), Churchill (the subject of his most famous histories), and in the lovely, musical last chapter, his three wives, also fall within the purview of his thoughtful, measured prose. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Becoming Americans in Paris: Transatlantic Politics and Culture between the World Wars</h2><p>Americans often look back on Paris between the world wars as a charming escape from the enduring inequalities and reactionary politics of the United States. In this bold and original study, Brooke Blower shows that nothing could be further from the truth. She reveals the breadth of American activities in the capital, the lessons visitors drew from their stay, and the passionate responses they elicited from others. For many sojourners-not just for the most famous expatriate artists and writers- Paris served as an important crossroads, a place where Americans reimagined their position in the world and grappled with what it meant to be American in the new century, even as they came up against conflicting interpretations of American power by others.<br> <br>Interwar Paris may have been a capital of the arts, notorious for its pleasures, but it was also smoldering with radical and reactionary plots, suffused with noise, filth, and chaos, teeming with immigrants and refugees, communist rioters, fascism admirers, overzealous police, and obnoxious tourists. Sketching Americans' place in this evocative landscape, Blower shows how arrivals were drawn into the capital's battles, both wittingly and unwittingly. Americans in Paris found themselves on the front lines of an emerging culture of political engagements-a transatlantic matrix of causes and connections, which encompassed debates about "Americanization" and "anti-American" protests during the Sacco-Vanzetti affair as well as a host of other international incidents. Blower carefully depicts how these controversies and a backdrop of polarized European politics honed Americans' political stances and sense of national distinctiveness.<br> <br>A model of urban, transnational history, <em>Becoming Americans in Paris</em> offers a nuanced portrait of how Americans helped to shape the cultural politics of interwar Paris, and, at the same time, how Paris helped to shape modern American political culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>Brooke L. Blower</strong> is Assistant Professor of History, Boston University.<br><br>"Cultural and political transnational history comes alive through Blower's engaging presentation of facts and analysis, accompanied by extensive notes and a comprehensive bibliography."--<em>French Review</em><p></p><br>"Blower writes well, engaging the reader with evocative details...<em>Becoming Americans in Paris</em> is a valuable contribution to understanding the conflicts and tensions involved in transnational exchanges and in the internationalization of America."--<em>The Journal of World History</em><p></p><br>"Practically anyone interested in Paris in the 1920s...should find this well-written and thoroughly researched view of the other side of 'Gay Paree' informative and stimulating."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"This intriguing read comes highly recommended. The author analyzes America's connection to Paris during the interwar years from new perspectives, undermining common perceptions of 'Gay Paree' as a refuge for carefree Americas, instead casting the City of Lights as an urban landscape where a range of cultural adn politicized interactions occured between a central location for the construction of an American identity through political culture."--<em>The Historian</em><p></p><br>"An excellent example of what transnational history ought to be....An illuminating, elegantly written, and extremely worthwhile enterprise."--<em>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</em><p></p><br>"Blower's new portrait of Americans in interwar Paris replaces Impressionist nostalgia with the sharp lights and shadows of an edgy Expressionist scene. With deft strokes based on deep and inventive research, this arresting narrative puts political disputes and class confrontations up close to caf� haunts, showing Paris locales testing and honing American sojourners' sense of self and nationhood."--Nancy F. Cott, Harvard University <br><p></p><br>"<em>Becoming Americans in Paris</em> is a marvelous rethinking of the shopworn clich� about the mythic and restorative qualities of Paris in the 1920s. With rich and compelling prose, Brooke L. Blower rethinks the oft-romanticized story of Americans in the postwar City of Light, emphasizing the frenetic scale of social networking, the angry depths of political passions, and the cultural significance of transatlantic confrontation. Entering Paris and becoming American, she argues, were closely related, hotly debated experiences, both for the New World colonists who elbowed their way into a wrecked European city and assumed a stance of superiority, and for the Parisians who often unhappily received their American guests. This is a model of transnational history."--Matthew Pratt Guterl, Indiana University <br><p></p><br>"Going beyond Hemingway's famous evocation of Americans in Paris, Brooke Blower gives us a larger and previously unknown story. Her account, built from Parisian archives, describes a semi-cloistered American colony embedded in a Paris that is not so gay: devastated by war, politically contentious, but cheap for those with American dollars, a source of Parisian resentment. Focused on specific Franco-American confrontations, this analysis of 'offshore' America illuminates what it meant to be an American of a certain class in the 1920s-and Parisian."--Thomas Bender, author of <em>New York Intellect</em> <br><p></p><br>"Until Brooke Blower's book, scholars have not fully appreciated the complex, intertwined histories of Americans and the city of Paris between the World Wars. She fundamentally revises the concept of 'expatriation' for students of American and French history by reframing this trans-Atlantic cultural exchange as a two-way street. Through exhaustive research solidly grounded in the histories of both countries and a beautifully written narrative, Blower deftly demonstrates how only in Paris could Americans become 'Americans' in the modern sense of that term, and how the City of Light was thoroughly changed by their presence."--Jeffrey H. Jackson, Rhodes College <br><p></p><br>"Brooke L. Blower has presented a brilliant work of engaged historiography, revealed previously hidden layers, and opened up new perspectives on a historical era of upheaval .She has revealed the buried layers of Paris between the World Wars and demystified the false and campy romanticization of Paris."--<em>SuKuLTuR</em><p></p><br><em>Becoming Americans in Paris</em> is an important book and adds an extra dimension to what we know about the city and the Americans who spend time there."--Jim Burns, <em>The Northern Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"An excellent example of what transnational history ought to be....An illuminating, elegantly written, and extremely worthwhile enterprise."--Martha Hanna, <em>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Reading Horizons 3 2 (Houghton Mifflin Reading)</h2><p>HOUGHTON MIFFLIN</p><p></p><h2>Kinesiology Flashcards</h2><p>Now with the 2-color illustrations from the new 4th edition Clinical Kinesiology and Anatomy text, these handy flashcards are an inexpensive and effective tool to help students memorize and master anatomy.

Patel challenges the widespread belief that music and language are processed independently. Since Plato's time, the relationship between music and language has attracted interest and debate from a wide range of thinkers. Recently, scientific research on this topic has been growing rapidly, as scholars from diverse disciplines, including linguistics, cognitive science, music cognition, and neuroscience are drawn to the music-language interface as one way to explore the extent to which different mental abilities are processed by separate brain mechanisms. Accordingly, the relevant data and theories have been spread across a range of disciplines. This volume provides the first synthesis, arguing that music and language share deep and critical connections, and that comparative research provides a powerful way to study the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these uniquely human abilities.<br><br>Winner of the 2008 ASCAP Deems Taylor Award.<br></p><p><br>Aniruddh D.

Although popular books on this subject abound, Patel has provided an up-to-date and authoritative academic treatment...<em>Music, Language, and the Brain</em> is an impressive feat of scholarship and comes highly recommended."--<em>Nature Neuroscience</em><p></p><br>"Patel's dissection of the multiple components of language and music cognition is elegant and deeply knowledgeable. His writing achieves a masterly balance. On the one hand he is bold and creative in uncovering and explaining important phenomena that link language and music. On the other hand he displays true scientific humility in refusing to speculate too far beyond the known facts. In a subject area prone to superficiality and overstatement, Patel is a sure and trustworthy guide for how to make real progress in understanding these complex but fascinating phenomena."--<em>John Sloboda,</em> <em>Professor of Psychology, Keele University</em><p></p><br>"This book will be required reading for specialists, and interesting and informative reading for everyone. It manages to combine remarkable breadth of coverage with genuine depth of understanding, and it's clearly and elegantly written. The author has a clear point of view and wants to get it across to other researchers, but never lets that get in the way of the book's more fundamental goal of putting the latest research within the reach of the interested non-specialist reader."--<em>D.R. Ladd, Professor of Linguistics, University of Edinburgh</em><p></p><br>"Reading Patel's <em>Music, Language, and the Brain</em> is a deeply rewarding experience. The question of whether parallels exist between music and language has until now been a question of wide interest and speculation. This landmark monograph provides a detailed and informed framework for examining this question scientifically. The presentation presumes no prior specialized knowledge and offers clear explanations of the technical ideas necessary inspiring agenda for future research, ranging from intriguing speculations to carefully-worked out experimental designs.<em>Music, Language, and the</em> <em>Brain</em> will shape and inform research on the relationship between music and language for decades to come."--<em>Carol L. Krumhansl, Prof. of Psychology, Cornell University</em><p></p><br>"...a wide-ranging, well-researched and highly readable exploration...Patel's book is the most scholarly and comprehensive account of the topic yet published. It should be of special interest not only to music psychologists and phonologists but also to other linguists who want to expand their horizons."--<em>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</em><p></p><br>"Written by a first-rate scientist, <em>Music, Language and the Brain</em> is the most comprehensive and clear treatment of the sometimes patchwork body of knowledge exploring music and language comparisons within music psychology and neuroscience. Patel's book makes an immediate and important contribution to the vast array of literature in this area by bringing it together in a single source. It is all the more impressive because of the author's ability to present this complex web of scholarship in a very logical and highly readable style...I am certain I will find myself returning to this resource many times."--Steven M. Demorest for <em>Empirical Musicology Review</em><p></p><br>"The book is dense, but not heavy, clear but not simple, rich but not arrogant. It is the type of book that needs to be discussed with other people, to savor, sip by sip, like a 10-year old Bourgogne."--<em>Music Perception</em><p></p><br>"What's great about this volume is that it provides an all-in-one compendium of a huge amount of information, nicely organized, with appropriate illustrations, and lavishly referenced throughout...Overall, this is a highly recommended read. It is stimulating and wide-ranging and contains material that readers of many backgrounds and levels will find interesting."--<em>Neuron</em><p></p><br>"Aniruddh Patel's book, <em>Music, Language and the Brain</em>, manages to be both admirably readable and also scholarly. Whilst there are other books dealing rigorously with the perceptual and cognitive aspects of language and music as separate topics, few, if any, authors have successfully tackled the task of exploring the overlap between the cognitive and neural mechanisms of these two uniquely human domains. Patel takes on the challenge of providing not only accurate coverage of exisiting research in the fields of language and music, but also a much needed synthesis that throws new light on the links between the two....Patel's research ideas could keep a battalion of investigators busy for the next decade.... It sets a gold standard for authors aiming to write a wide-ranging, yet not over-technical book which is comprehensible and without having sacrificed intellectual integrity in the search for glib generalizations."--<em>Brain</em><p></p><br>"A scientific <em>tour de force</em>.... Monumental in scope and in proportion, the value of this volume as an academic resource is immense. A vast amount of research is packed into its 513 pages and Patel demonstrates perspicacity and clarity of expression throughout... <em>Music, Language, and the Brain</em> makes a profound scientific contribution to the study of music and language...no other single source equips readers more thoroughly to explore the cognitive intersection between these two domains."--<em>Psychology of Music</em><p></p><br>"...<em>Music, Language and the Brain</em> reaches far and ranges wide, its themes and arguments irreducible to the sum of prior formulations on the "music of language" and the "language of music." Seldom does one encounter so voluminous a repertory of empirical evidence so deftly marshaled by so communicative an intellect."--<em>Notes</em><p></p><br>"....this book is an accessible and invaluable resource....In an age of lip service to interdisciplinarity, Patel rolls up his sleeves and starts building bridges, not just among the subdisciplines of cognitive science, but also between the science and humanities. I recommend this book enthusiastically as a guide to language and music in the brain and mind, and as a model of integrative thinking."--Reviewed by Daniel Casasanto, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, in <em>Language and Cognition</em><p></p><br>The strength of Patel's book is its ability to provide in-depth studies of music and linguistic cognition in a manner that illustrates both their interconnectedness and their differences. Any student of music theory would benefit from Patel's explanations of mental processing of music and its theoretical foundations; any student of linguistic theory would benefit from his neurological analogies. As the study of music cognition continues to grow, the present work will become an increasingly important resource."--<em>Music Theory Online</em><p></p><br>"<em>Music, Language, and the Brain</em> provides a fascinating synopsis of the current, young state of scientific research in cross-domain language--music comparative study. The book traverses with ease the disciplinary lines of linguistics, music and neuroscience.

This makes it very difficult to keep up with trends and issues. Building a personal learning network will help overcome the isolation.</p><p></p><p>Most school librarians are solo librarians working away from little direct contact with their counterparts in schools and in other types of libraries. Sometimes this is geography and other times it is the lack of opportunities within their school districts or communities to become acquainted and communicate. It is very difficult to keep up with trends and issues, new methods or activities that should be tried in libraries. For those who did not learn the importance of professional development in their education programs, the author discusses the need for the solo librarian to remain current and to continue to find ways to use in continuing advocacy for their school library programs. Building a personal learning network can help overcome the isolation. Opportunities for becoming active at the state and national level are described as well as how to go beyond the library. Social bookmarking, social networks, and online conferences are discussed. Because many lack funds to attend conferences, readers will be pleased to learn that most of the activities can be done without leaving home.</p></p><p><p>School librarians are often isolated from other professionals.

In a close examination of the 1850s, Mark W. Summers shows that the Barbecue was well under ten years before the war began: embezzling treasurers, bribe-giving lobbyists, office brokers, and claims swindlers were pervasive in antebellum America. Summers contends that corruption, North and South, undermined the Jacksonian party system, irritated sectional jealousies, discredited compromise, and ultimately aided in the death of the Union. A compelling, often lurid tale, the story of the &#34;plundering generation&#34; raises important questions about the significance of corruption for policy-making and American political thought.</p><p></p><h2>The spaces in between;: An architect&#39;s journey</h2><p>Jacket rates fair, with a piece missing at bottom of spine.

Analysing the contradictions of U.S. power while illustrating the real progress won by sustained popular struggle, Chomsky cuts through official political rhetoric to examine how the United States not only violates the UD, but at times uses it as a weapon to wield against designated enemies.</p><p>The United States government often invokes a moral imperative to honor human rights as justification for its foreign-policy decisions. But, according to Noam Chomsky, America's actual track record falls far short of the principles iterated in 1948's Universal Declaration of Human Rights--the accepted international standard. This slim but passionate volume lists case after case in which the United States has provided aid to grossly abusive regimes--among which Chomsky includes Israel and Indonesia--and examples of how the American government seeks to limit the human rights of its own citizens. With equal criticism for Democrat and Republican administrations, <i>The Umbrella of U.S. Power</i> refuses to remain silent about "the things it 'wouldn't do' to mention" as it works to expose the contradictions between what government leaders tell their people and what they actually do. <i>--Ron Hogan</i>Born in Philadelphia in 1928, <b>NOAM CHOMSKY</b> is known throughout the world for his political writings, activism, and for for his groundbreaking work in linguistics. A professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 1955, Chomsky gained recognition in academic circles for his theory of transformational grammar, which drew attention to the syntactic universality of all human languages. But it is as a critic of unending war, corporate control and neoliberalism that Chomsky has become one of the country&#x2019;s most well known public intellectuals. The 1969 publication of <i>American Power and the New Mandarins</i> marked the beginning of Chomsky&#x2019;s rigorous public criticism of American hegemony and its lieges. Since then, with his tireless scholarship and an unflagging sense of moral responsibility, he has become one of the most influential writers in the world. Chomsky is the author of <i>Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media</i> (with Edward S. Herman), <i>Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order</i>, and over one hundred other books. To this day Noam Chomsky remains an active and uncompromising voice of dissent.</p><h2>The Einstein Factor: A Proven New Method for Increasing Your Intelligence</h2><p><b>"<i>The Einstein Factor</i> is a winner.&nbsp; It should go to every man, woman and child in the land... a fine, yeasty book."</b><br>--LYNN SCHROEDER, co-author of <i>Superlearning</i> and <i>Superlearning 2000</i><br><br><b>"<i>The Einstein Factor</i> liberates mental abilities you didn't know you had.&nbsp; I tried thetechniques in the book and they paid off instantly.&nbsp; It's almost scary."</b><br>--DUNCAN MAXWELL ANDERSON, senior editor, <i>Success</i>.<br>New research suggests that the superior achievements of famous thinkers may have been more the result of mental conditioning than genetic superiority.

This vital book argues for the importance of a new civic professionalism that reflects the ideals of democracy and public service in our ever more complex economic environment. A publication of The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, <i>Work and Integrity</i> explores the most current thinking on the various (and often conflicting) ways in which the concept of professional work is understood. Using examples from the United States and Europe, the author describes how the professions evolved from a limited kind of genteel occupation into one of the most widely emulated and sought-after models of work. The book also explores the rise of complex institutions of industrial and postindustrial society, especially the university and the bureaucratic structures of business, government, health care, and education.</p><p>A co-author of the landmark <i>Habits of the Heart</i> and one of our most practiced observers of American culture focuses on the crisis in confidence that has undermined the image of the professional in America and examines the effects of this crisis on our society.A Constructive Response to the Current Crisis of Confidence in the Professions <p>"For generations the professions have combined expert knowledge with public service in a proud sense of calling.

In Work and Integrity, William Sullivan persuasively shows that those who educate the next generation of professionals should also be nurturing an ethic of 'civic professionalism,' an understanding that the professions have a vital public responsibility.

His work on the completeness of logic, the incompleteness of number theory, and the consistency of the axiom of choice and the continuum theory brought him further worldwide fame. In this introductory volume, Raymond Smullyan, himself a well-known logician, guides the reader through the fascinating world of Godel's incompleteness theorems. The level of presentation is suitable for anyone with a basic acquaintance with mathematical logic. As a clear, concise introduction to a difficult but essential subject, the book will appeal to mathematicians, philosophers, and computer scientists.<br></p><p>Raymond M. Smullyan is at Indiana University, Bloomington."A delightful introduction to the Godel incompleteness theorems and related results. . . . reader is treated to a series of careful formulations and proofs of the central results, always with a high degree of generality and insight.

In 2005 he received an Award for Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.This is among the best of modern translations of Catullus. It is responsive to the diversity of Catullan meters and captures his swing from the voice of impassioned lover to that of abusive reviler, from the language of refinement and learning to that of a man-about-town conversant with street gutterese. The poems in this translation hold together well as a unified oeuvre while conveying with remarkable success Catullus's wit, elegantly controlled passion, and intermixture of contemporary Roman scenes and vast mythological landscapes.<br><i>- Stephen Scully, Boston Univ.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cambridge Grammar for IELTS Student&#39;s Book with Answers and Audio CD (Cambridge Books for Cambridge Exams)</h2><p>Cambridge Grammar for IELTS provides complete coverage of the grammar needed for the IELTS test, and develops listening skills at the same time.

Thoreau's compelling account of Cape Cod contains the complete, definitive text of the original. Introduced by American poet and literary critic Robert Pinsky--himself a resident of Cape Cod--this volume contains some of Thoreau's most beautiful writings.</p><br><p> In the plants, animals, topography, weather, and people of Cape Cod, Thoreau finds "another world" Encounters with the ocean dominate this book, from the fatal shipwreck of the opening chapter to his later reflections on the Pilgrims' landing and reconnaissance. Along the way, Thoreau relates the experiences of fishermen and oystermen, farmers and salvagers, lighthouse-keepers and ship captains, as well as his own intense confrontations with the sea as he travels the land's outermost margins. Chronicles of exploration, settlement, and survival on the Cape lead Thoreau to reconceive the history of New England--and to recognize the parochialism of history itself.</p></p><p><b>Robert Pinsky</b> is Professor of English at Boston University and an editor of the weekly online magazine <i>Slate</i>. He is the author of many books of poetry and literary criticism. He served two terms as United States Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, 1997-2000.This relatively minor work by Thoreau illustrates the qualities that define his greatest works: his clarity and ease of style, and his concreteness as a naturalist and observer of nature and society. Compiled from magazine articles published in the 1850s after his death, these chapters detail several short trips Thoreau made to "the bare and bended arm of Massachusetts" between 1849 and 1855. Patrick Cullen's unforced and straightforward delivery treats the text as journalism and travelogue, rather than lyrical prose, and thus conveys both Thoreau's strengths as a reporter and the secret of handling this author successfully in the audio format. In addition to its literary merit, this book is also an effective evocation of Cape Cod a century and a half ago, when the old ways were being both lost and preserved against the encroachments of civilization, technology, and inexorable modernity.

Deemed insane by the Christian church, Rupescissa had spent more than a decade confined to prisons&#x2014;in one case wrapped in chains and locked under a staircase&#x2014;yet ill treatment could not silence the friar's apocalyptic message. <br><br>Religious figures who preached the end times were hardly rare in the late Middle Ages, but Rupescissa's teachings were unique. He claimed that knowledge of the natural world, and alchemy in particular, could act as a defense against the plagues and wars of the last days. His melding of apocalyptic prophecy and quasi-scientific inquiry gave rise to a new genre of alchemical writing and a novel cosmology of heaven and earth. Most important, the friar's research represented a remarkable convergence between science and religion.<br><br>In order to understand scientific knowledge today, Leah DeVun asks that we revisit Rupescissa's life and the critical events of his age&#x2014;the Black Death, the Hundred Years' War, the Avignon Papacy&#x2014;through his eyes. Rupescissa treated alchemy as medicine (his work was the conceptual forerunner of pharmacology) and represented the emerging technologies and views that sought to combat famine, plague, religious persecution, and war. The advances he pioneered, along with the exciting strides made by his contemporaries, shed critical light on later developments in medicine, pharmacology, and chemistry.</p><p>In the middle of the fourteenth century, the Franciscan friar John of Rupescissa sent a dramatic warning to his followers: the end times were coming; the apocalypse was near.

He is the author of <em>English Art 1870-1940</em> and General Editor of the Clarendon Studies in the History of Art.<br>A handy work based on earlier Oxford Companions and revised from previous editions, this single-volume reference contains 3000 entries that discuss Western and Western-inspired art from antiquity on. It considers paintings, graphics, sculpture, and architecture in terms of artistic figures, periods, schools, techniques, critical terms, and museums; lesser artists are treated more concisely than major ones. Despite editorial claims that the dictionary is "up to date," coverage of recent activities is uneven, with Neo-expressionism and other contemporary movements and artists omitted. An easy format, accurate facts, and good cross-referencing make this a useful lexicon for the layperson or for general and public collections.

His aim is to reveal, by careful analysis of the works from Der fliegende Hollander to Parsifal, the dominant features of &#39;music drama&#39; and how Wagner achieves such profound, unified effects. Professor Dahlhaus cites music examples only when they are germane to his argument and requires from his readers no more than a limited amount of technical musical knowledge. This is not, therefore, an exclusively specialist study. Rather it will help the enthusiastic beginner to come to terms with these great works of art as well as offering many valuable insights to the experienced Wagnerian. The book will be of interest to students and scholars of music history, theory, opera and philosophy.</p><p>Previous studies of Wagner&#39;s operas have tended to approach the works as chunks of autobiography, philosophical speculations or historical-political comments on the age in which they were written.

Two new books on this important writer are being prepared by Faber poet Julia Copus, who recently unveiled a blue plaque on Mew&#x2019;s childhood house in Doughty Street.<br><br>Mew was a curious mix of New Woman and stalwart Victorian. Her poems speak to us strongly today, in these strangely mixed times of exposure and seclusion: they reveal the private agony of an isolated being who was forced to keep secret the tragedies of her personal life while being at the same time propelled by her work into the public arena. Her poetry transfigures that very private suffering into art that has a universal resonance.</p><p><b>Charlotte Mew</b> (1869&#x2013;1928) was an English writer notable for her short well-crafted, highly original poetry.

A vivid exploration of the mysteries of seamanship, the story builds in excitement as these two young adventurers discover a German plot to invade England.</p><p>While on a sailing trip in the Baltic Sea, two young adventurers-turned-spies uncover a secret German plot to invade England. Written by Childers--who served in the Royal Navy during World War I--as a wake-up call to the British government to attend to its North Sea defenses, &#34;The Riddle of the Sands accomplished that task and has been considered a classic of espionage literature ever since, praised as much for its nautical action as for its suspenseful spycraft.&#x201c;This is a book of great renown. . . .

Vulnerability to cyber attacks can be significantly reduced if the basics are practiced. A clear understanding of the fundamentals can help ensure that adequate detective and protective controls are in place, and that a solid information security foundation is established. This book covers concepts and controls. It is a good primer for those new to the field, and a refresher for the more seasoned practitioner. It is for those who are tasked with creating, leading, supporting or improving an organization&#x2019;s cyber security program. The goal is to help clear some of the fog that can get in the way of implementing cyber security best practices. The security controls that are discussed in these 100 concise pages are each assigned a maturity level. This helps the reader determine which controls are most appropriate for it&#x2019;s organization. Maturity of a program is based on its age, the resources that are available to it, and the amount of leadership support it enjoys. Advanced controls are not appropriate for a newly-established program, for example. Reading this book will break down cognitive barriers. It will provide security practitioners the best practices necessary to detect and mitigate common and sophisticated attacks. Building a solid information security foundation does not have to be complicated. It can be achieved by applying the fundamentals of cyber security.</p><p></p><h2>Your Best Destiny: Becoming the Person You Were Created to Be</h2><p>When you imagine what it would take for your life to be truly great&#x2015;for you to become your best, most fulfilled self&#x2015;do you dream of something more than what you have now?

It provides an overview of the concepts and theoretical foundations of developmental practices and discusses the practical implications for teachers and caregivers. Reflecting the NAEYC position statement on Developmentally Appropriate Practice, the book includes content on aligning early childhood teaching practices with national education standards. Section I explores developmentally appropriate practice, including an in-depth section on the theory and research of play as well as discussion of early learning standards in curriculum development. Readers also learn how well known curriculum approaches fit into the principles of developmentally appropriate practice. Subsequent sections, which discuss the physical, social/emotional, and cognitive/language domains, individually address appropriate practice for infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and primary-aged children. Section V, available on the book&#39;s website, discusses how teachers can make changes that result in more developmentally appropriate practices and how to gain support for those changes with families and communities.

Structured as a series of inquiries into the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation Archives at Taliesin West, Arizona (recently acquired by MoMA and Avery Architectural &amp; Fine Arts Library, Columbia University), the book is a collection of scholarly explorations rather than an attempt to construct a master narrative. Each chapter centers on a key object from the archive that an invited author has &#x201c;unpacked&#x201d;&#x2015; tracing its meanings and connections, and juxtaposing it with other works from the archive, from MoMA, or from outside collections. Wright&#x2019;s quest to build a mile-high skyscraper reveals him to be one of the earliest celebrity architects, using television, press relations and other forms of mass media to advance his own self-crafted image. A little-known project for a Rosenwald School for African-American children, together with other projects that engage Japanese and Native American culture, ask provocative questions about Wright&#x2019;s positions on race and cultural identity. Still other investigations engage the architect&#x2019;s lifelong dedication to affordable and do-it-yourself housing, as well as the ecological systems, both social and environmental, that informed his approach to cities, landscapes and even ornament. The publication aims to open up Wright&#x2019;s work to questions, interrogations and debates, and to highlight interpretations by contemporary scholars, both established Wright experts and others considering this iconic figure from new and illuminating perspectives.</p></p><p><p><b>Carole Ann Fabian</b> is Director of Avery Architectural &amp; Fine Arts Library at Columbia University.</p><p><b>Barry Bergdoll</b> is Curator of the Department of Architecture and Design at The Museum of Modern Art and Meyer Schapiro Professor of Art History and Archaeology in the Department of Art History, Columbia University.</p><p><b>Matthew Skjonsberg</b> is a Ph.D. Researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland.</p><p><b>Michael Osman</b> is Associate Professor in the Department of Architecture and Design at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p><b>Neil Levine</b> is Emmet Blakeney Gleason Professor of History of Art and Modern Architecture at Harvard University.</p><p><b>Jennifer Gray</b> is Project Research Assistant in the Department of Architecture and Design at The Museum of Modern Art, New York.</p><p><b>Therese O&#x2019;Malley</b> is Associate Dean in the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, National Gallery of Art, Washington DC.</p><p><b>Juliet Kinchin</b> is Curator of the Department of Architecture and Design at The Museum of Modern Art, New York.</p><p><b>Ken Tadashi Oshima</b> is Professor in Department of Architecture at the University of Washington.</p><p><b>Elizabeth S.

Smart, inquisitive, industrious, sociable, and twice widowed, Delany kept up a lively correspondence, gardened, drew, painted, and excelled in many handicrafts, including shellwork, needlework, and, most famously, her paper collages. As Horace Walpole wrote with great admiration, Delany, then in her seventies, &#x201c;invented the art of paper-mosaic&#x201d; and rapidly constructed nearly 1,000 botanical collages of such precision and beauty they never fail to astonish viewers. Although she was part of her era&#x2019;s leading circle of writers, scientists, and artists, the full story of her life, achievements, and influence has never before been told as sensitively and thoroughly as it is in this sumptuously illustrated volume. From a step-by-step explanation of Delany&#x2019;s paper-mosaic technique to appreciation for her dazzling floral textile designs to a discussion of the social role of women&#x2019;s handicrafts, this portrait of a &#x201c;lover and conscientious observer of the natural world&#x201d; and consummate craftswoman is superbly illuminating. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Pierre Bonnard: Painting Arcadia</h2><p>This lavishly illustrated volume examines the genius of Pierre Bonnard, whose utopian vision bridged both Impressionism and modernism. Pierre Bonnard is often considered a painter of idyllic scenes, replete with color and serenity, however, this view overlooks many of the most striking aspects of Bonnard&#x2019;s oeuvre. Over the course of his career, Bonnard worked within&#x2015;often expanding and challenging&#x2015;many genres and techniques. Alternating between the traditions of Impressionism and the abstract visual modes of modernism, Bonnard addressed elements present within many movements in order to synthesize a world worthy of his utopian vision. As this exquisitely produced volume reveals, Bonnard&#x2019;s work evolved radically over the course of his career. Included in its pages are illustrations of well-known examples alongside rarely exhibited pieces, which represent the many thematic and stylistic compositions of Bonnard&#x2019;s work. The book features the murals and tapestries he created with the Nabis; his lush interiors and depictions of his wife, Marthe; his extraordinary use of rich color, brush strokes, and perspective; and his contemplative portraits. Interwoven throughout these dazzling reproductions are illuminating texts by acclaimed critics who draw on the latest research to present a multi-dimensional account of the artist. Readers of this gorgeous, authoritative book can look forward to a visual and intellectual treat in which Bonnard&#x2019;s status is elevated from a forerunner of modernism to one of the greatest painters of the 19th and 20th centuries.</p><p>Guy Cogeval is President of the Musee d&#39;Orsay and the Musee de l&#39;Orangerie in Paris.

And yet, in putting a charismatic Satan and naked Adam and Eve at the centre of this story, he also created an intensely human tragedy on the Fall of Man. Written when Milton was in his fifties, blind, bitterly disappointed by the Restoration and briefly in danger of execution, &#34;Paradise Lost&#39;s&#34; apparent ambivalence towards authority has led to intense debate about whether it manages to justify the &#39;ways of God to men&#39;, or exposes the cruelty of Christianity.</p><p>This is the first fully-annotated, old-spelling edition of Paradise Lost to be published in this century. It surveys in its introduction and incorporates in its notes the large amount of criticism published between 1965 and the present--not to mention the criticism that began with Dryden, Addison, Samuel Johnson, and William Blake--and it reflects critical perspectives from New Criticism to Deconstruction, from Philology to New Historicism and Feminism. On the page, the book combines the look and feel of original editions with the convenience of wide margins and thorough annotation.<b>John Milton</b> (1608-1674) spent his early years in scholarly pursuit.

Assisted by Becker's sage advice, students can make better sense of their research and simultaneously generate fresh ideas on where to look next for new data. The tricks cover four broad areas of social science: the creation of the "imagery" to guide research; methods of "sampling" to generate maximum variety in the data; the development of "concepts" to organize findings; and the use of "logical" methods to explore systematically the implications of what is found. Becker's advice ranges from simple tricks such as changing an interview question from "Why?" to "How?" (as a way of getting people to talk without asking for a justification) to more technical tricks such as how to manipulate truth tables.<br><br>Becker has extracted these tricks from a variety of fields such as art history, anthropology, sociology, literature, and philosophy; and his dazzling variety of references ranges from James Agee to Ludwig Wittgenstein. Becker finds the common principles that lie behind good social science work, principles that apply to both quantitative and qualitative research. He offers practical advice, ideas students can apply to their data with the confidence that they will return with something they hadn't thought of before.<br><br>Like <i>Writing for Social Scientists, Tricks of the Trade</i> will bring aid and comfort to generations of students. Written in the informal, accessible style for which Becker is known, this book will be an essential resource for students in a wide variety of fields.<br><br>"An instant classic. . . .

David Greenstone Book Award from the Politics and History section of the American Political Science Association.</p> <p> </p> <p>Winner of the 2005 Ralph J. Bunche Award of the American Political Science Association<br></p> <p> </p><p>Winner of the 2005 V.O. Key, Jr. Award of the Southern Political Science Association</p> <br> The Reconstruction era marked a huge political leap for African Americans, who rapidly went from the status of slaves to voters and officeholders. Yet this hard-won progress lasted only a few decades. Ultimately a "second reconstruction"&#x2014;associated with the civil rights movement and the Voting Rights Act&#x2014;became necessary.<br> <br> How did the first reconstruction fail so utterly, setting the stage for the complete disenfranchisement of Southern black voters, and why did the second succeed? These are among the questions Richard M. Valelly answers in this fascinating history. The fate of black enfranchisement, he argues, has been closely intertwined with the strengths and constraints of our political institutions. Valelly shows how effective biracial coalitions have been the key to success and incisively traces how and why political parties and the national courts either rewarded or discouraged the formation of coalitions.<br> <br> Revamping our understanding of American race relations, <i>The Two Reconstructions</i> brilliantly explains a puzzle that lies at the heart of America&#x2019;s development as a political democracy.<p></p></p><p><b>Richard M.

(<i>Ralph Bunch Award</i> 2005-01-01)<br><br>"In these days of microscopic studies in the social sciences and humanities, the author's breadth of intellectual concern is admirable indeed." (<i>Political Science Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"A valuable contribution to the literature on American political development and the Reconstruction era that should be of some interest to judicial scholars, especially those interested in supplementing their knowledge of the non-judicial aspects of the first Reconstruction." (Emery G. Lee III <i>Law and Politics</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Richard M. Valelly&#x2019;s magisterial work <i>The Two Reconstructions</i> will stand for a long time as the definitive political analysis of racial suppression and redemption in American democracy. . . . Valelly [compares] the two reconstructions in every dimension&#x2014;the coalition politics on which they rested, the role of courts, the dynamics of Southern white resistance, and the legislative and judicial means for securing democracy. Many of the instruments of the second reconstruction, such as federal registrars, were echoes of the aborted first one. Likewise, the subterfuges devised by white supremacists to destroy black suffrage in the late 19th century were often the same ones still deployed, or redeployed, a century later. . . . With the [Voting Rights Act] up for renewal in 2007, Valelly shows how more conservative courts and new tactics of vote dilution or suppression again put full democracy at risk. &#x2018;As a country, we still have important business to do.&#x2019;&#x201d; </p> (Robert Kuttner <i>American Prospect</i>)<br><br>"Valelly has written a book that offers a rich database of facts contrasting a successful and unsuccessful instance of institutionalization. It deserves to be read by social movement scholars and political sociologists, as well as anyone with an interest in the roots of black social inequality." (Martin Ruef <i>American Journal of Sociology</i>)<br><br>"This is the best work ever written comparing Reconstruction after the Civil War with the reconstruction of race relations since World War II. Combining a mastery of the vast historical literature with a political scientist's emphasis on the ways coalitions are built, maintained, and eroded, Vallely convincingly pushes economic and cultural factors to the side and restore mass and judicial politics to their rightful place at the center of the histopry of racial change in America. On questions large and small . . . Vallely consistently illuminates." (J. Morgan Kousser <i>Law and History Review</i>)<br><br>"Valelly has made and judicious use of history.

Cognitive sociology has long addressed the way we perceive or imagine boundaries in our ordinary lives, but Asia Friedman pushes this question further still.

In this book, Rod Andrew Jr. offers an authoritative and comprehensive biography of Pickens the man, the general, the planter, and the diplomat. Andrew vividly depicts Pickens as he founds churches, acquires slaves, joins the Patriot cause, and struggles over Indian territorial boundaries on the southern frontier. Combining insights from military and social history, Andrew argues that while Pickens's actions consistently reaffirmed the authority of white men, he was also determined to help found the new republic based on broader principles of morality and justice.<br><br>After the war, Pickens sought a peaceful and just relationship between his country and the southern Native American tribes and wrestled internally with the issue of slavery. Andrew suggests that Pickens's rise to prominence, his stern character, and his sense of duty highlight the egalitarian ideals of his generation as well as its moral shortcomings--all of which still influence Americans' understanding of themselves.<br><br></p><p>Rod Andrew Jr. is professor of history at Clemson University.Invaluable for those interested in the finer points of the Revolution in the Carolina backcountry, the postwar shaping of frontier democracy, or a historical work that centers evangelical Christianity in the Revolution and early republic.--<i>North Carolina Historical Review</i><br>Provides a well-deserved new treatment of Pickens as a military hero, civic leader, and self-made man who was not only a product of the frontier Revolutionary ethos of his day, but also an important shaper of it . . . a masterfully told story.--<i>On Point</i><br>An outstanding book, long awaited by history buffs that will serve as a milestone on an important Revolutionary War military leader.--<i>McCormick Messenger</i><br>This clearly written, well-constructed, and thoroughly researched book provides a welcome addition to Revolutionary and Indian affairs scholarship.--<i>The Journal of Southern History</i><br>Other biographies of Pickens have been written, but this is the best.

Wiles analyses the writings of the Greek and Latin commentators of the third, fourth and early fifth centuries. The patristic exegesis of St Paul is concerned with a wide range of doctrinal issues. these include, in particular, the great issues of grace and faith which were of such importance at the time of the Reformation. Wiles questions whether the Fathers were as insensitive to the Pauline teaching about grace as is often claimed.

An army of mounted warriors, travelling with peasants, merchants and artisans, faced a journey over hostile terrain, meeting with unforeseen antagonism, desert heat, and the constant struggle to feed and water their troops and horses. Remittance from penance, a desire to see the Holy Places, or greed for the power and booty to be captured in the East spurred the crusaders on towards the prize, be it spiritual or temporal, of the Holy City of Jerusalem. Their journey&#39;s spectacular culmination was the long siege of Jerusalem, at the end of which the Crusaders, by a brilliant tactical manoeuvre, broke down its defences and poured into the city which erupted in a bloody massacre. Steven Runciman&#39;s History of the Crusades is justly acclaimed as the most complete and fascinating account of the historic journey to save the Holy Lands from the infidel.</p><p>Whether the Crusades are regarded as the most tremendous and romantic of Christian expeditions or the last of the barbarian invasions, they remain one of the most exciting and colorful adventure stories in history.

Whereas interpreting used to be a community-based practice, the field is growing into a research-based profession that begins in a classroom rather than in the Deaf community. Despite the many gains being made in the interpreting services profession, with an emphasis on the accuracy of the interpreted work, the perspectives of Deaf individuals are rarely documented in the literature. Opportunities for enhanced participation and full inclusion need to be considered in order for Deaf people to best represent themselves to the hearing, nonsigning public as competent and intelligent individuals.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Deaf Eyes on Interpreting</i> brings Deaf people to the forefront of the discussions about what constitutes quality interpreting services. The contributors are all Deaf professionals who use interpreters on a regular basis, and their insights and recommendations are based on research as well as on personal experiences. These multiple perspectives reveal strategies to maximize access to interpreted work and hearing environments and to facilitate trust and understanding between interpreters and Deaf consumers. Interpreter educators, interpreting students, professional interpreters, and Deaf individuals will all benefit from the approaches offered in this collection.</p><p><b>Thomas K.

In developing his arguments, author Gary Dean Best focuses on the fact that the depression continued through eight years of the Roosevelt administration, despite unprecedented intervention by the federal government in the nation's economic life. Challenging conventional explanations that fault Roosevelt for not embracing Keynesian spending on a scale sufficient to produce recovery, Best finds the roots of America's slow return to economic health in Roosevelt's hostility to the very groups he should have been encouraging: the American business and financial communities.</p><p></p><p>Best provides one of the most careful and objective studies published to date on the actual effects of Roosevelt's policies and programs on American business operations and psychology. He reexamines the issue of why businessmen and bankers were so critical of the New Deal--criticisms that have been, until now, largely dismissed as motivated by greed and selfishness. He also asks how Roosevelt and his advisors could have hoped to produce an economic recovery when a state of near war existed between the administration and the employers and investors who, alone, could produce such a recovery. Using the letters and diaries of the New Deal's business and other critics during the decade as well as the writings in banking and business periodicals of the day and the criticisms of contemporary economists, including Keynes himself, Best offers a persuasive indictment of New Deal policies and a more realistic explanation of America's failure to recover from the depression before World War II than has yet been available. His work is an important counterweight to conventional evaluations of Roosevelt and the New Deal and should be required reading in any course dealing with the history and politics of the 1930s.</p></p><p><p>Best argues that Roosevelt was himself the primary obstacle to American recovery from the Great Depression.

Millions of people turn to self-improvement when they find that their lives aren't working out quite as they had imagined. The market for self-improvement products--books, audiotapes, life-makeover seminars and regimens of all kinds--is exploding, and there seems to be no end in sight for this trend. In <em>Self-Help, Inc.</em>, cultural critic Micki McGee asks what our seemingly insatiable demand for self-help can tell us about ourselves at the outset of this new century. This lucid and fascinating book reveals how makeover culture traps Americans in endless cycles of self-invention and overwork, and offers suggestions for how we can address the alienating conditions of modern work and family life.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Micki McGee</strong> is a sociologist and cultural critic who has taught at New York University, Rutgers University, and The New School for Social Research. The recipient of numerous grants and fellowships, including residencies at the MacDowell Colony and Blue Mountain Center, she has recently joined the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Fordham University.<br><br>"McGee writes clearly and thoughtfully.... She moves seamlessly from high theory to pop psychobabble, using the former to illustrate the powers of the latter. Overall, she offers a compelling argument for resisting the self-improvement genre's worldview."--<em>American Journal of Sociology</em><p></p><br>"But credit for coming up with real insight into the self-help juggernaut more properly belongs to Micki McGee, a faculty fellow at New York University and the author of <em>Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover Culture in American Life</em>.... "McGee's grasp of the philosophical underpinnings... is formidable."--<em>Salon</em><p></p><br>"Sociologist and cultural critic McGee offers a nuanced examination of the socioeconomic roots and attractions of self-help.... She argues, elegantly and persuasively, that self-help's individualistic approach and its false assumption of autonomy disregard the systemic social inequities that cause individual discontent and do not acknowledge social solutions that might actually help.... scholarly in tone but accessible to interested general readers. Recommended for public and undergraduate collections."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"From Cotton Mather to Stephen Covey, America has been the land of self help. But why, Micki McGee asks, do we see a two-fold increase in self-help books in the last quarter century? Partly, she argues, because women now stand beside men in the hazardous new economy, and like them need help navigating it. Such books propose that we create out of a miscellany of jobs our own career punch-lines, that we reinvent ourselves when market demand turns quixotically elsewhere. Where, she asks, is a vision of a better way to do this thing called life? Elegantly written, brilliantly argued, and very important, a must read."--Arlie Russell Hochschild, author of <em>The Time Bind</em> and <em>The Commercialization of Intimate Life</em><p></p><br>"Self-help overemphasizes the individual's agency at the expense of the necessary reliance on or assistance of a network of others, and it can be sexist, too, says McGee.... To McGee, it's such mendacity that lies at the core of the self-help project, for we cannot make ourselves. Fortunately, her gracefully written account is tinged with sympathy for the harried souls for whom 'self-improvement is suggested as the only reliable insurance against economic insecurity' at a time when companies do not properly look after their workers."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Wander through virtually any bookstore across the country and you will be swamped by the self-help section, edging its way closer and closer to the heart of the shop. Micki McGee helps us to track this phenomenon, from its ancestral roots in an unsure immigrant culture to its beating heart in a risky neoliberal one. Wonderfully researched, superbly written, well-organised--this is simply a stand-out of contemporary cultural studies."--Toby Miller, author of <em>The Well-Tempered Self</em><p></p><br>"From its beginnings, the 'tale of before and after' has been a central myth of American life. For many, the opportunity of self-improvement is regarded as a national birthright. In her penetrating exploration of this enduring cultural tradition--particularly as it has unfolded in recent decades--Micki McGee has revealed the self-help industry as an obsessional treadmill far more than a path to a better life.

Luckily, though, the people driving this evelopment realized early on that if these extensions to the language were not handled sensibly, they could end up as an unwieldy, tangled web of tags. Thus HTML was created using the Document Object Model (DOM) meaning that all elements of a web page are uniquely addressable from both JavaScript and CSS.<br><br> More than that, it's also easy to insert PHP script commands into web pages too, and even integrate them with a database such as MySQL, to provide powerful back-end functionality, and the backbone of the Ajax process of behind-the-scenes communications between a web server and web browser.<br><br> In these days of widely varying browser capabilities and screen dimensions, developing code for a widening range of platforms such as iPhones, iPads, Android devices, PCs, Macs, tablets and so on, is more complicated than ever.

Wyeth (1882&#x2013;1945) was widely renowned for his iconic images of characters such as King Arthur, Robin Hood, and Robinson Crusoe that were reproduced as illustrations for books and magazines. The patriarch of the Wyeth family, father of Andrew Wyeth and grandfather of Jamie, he was also an artist with a broad purview whose work includes impressionist views of the Pennsylvania countryside and 1930s modernist interpretations of Maine coastal scenes.<br> &nbsp;<br> The book&#x2019;s essays look at topics such as Wyeth&#x2019;s contributions to the visual mythology of the American West, the darker nuances found in his <i>Treasure Island</i> illustrations, and correlations between his illustrations and cinema. Also explored is the way in which Wyeth&#x2019;s own Chadds Ford properties reflect his conception of home and the role of the artist in American society.

Molly Gibson is the daughter of the doctor in the small provincial town of Hollingford. Her widowed father marries a second time to give Molly the woman's presence he feels she lacks, but until the<br>arrival of Cynthia, her dazzling step-sister, Molly finds her situation hard to accept. Intertwined with the story of the Gibsons is that of Squire Hamley and his two sons; as Molly grows up and falls in love she learns to judge people for what they are, not what they seem. Through Molly's<br>observations the hierarchies, social values, and social changes of early nineteenth-century English life are made vivid in a novel that is timeless in its representation of human relationships.<br>This edition, the first to be based in the original Cornhill Magazine serialization of 1864-6, draws on a full collation of the manuscript to present the most accurate text so far available.</p><p>Set in English society before the 1832 Reform Bill, Wives and Daughters centres on the story of youthful Molly Gibson, brought up from childhood by her father. When he remarries, a new step-sister enters Molly&#39;s quiet life - loveable, but worldly and troubling, Cynthia. The narrative traces the development of the two girls into womanhood within the gossiping and watchful society of Hollingford. Wives and Daughters is far more than a nostalgic evocation of village life; it offers an ironic critique of mid-Victorian society. &#39;No nineteenth-century novel contains a more devastating rejection than this of the Victorian male assumption of moral authority&#39;, writes Pam Morris in her introduction to this new edition, in which she explores the novel&#39;s main themes - the role of women, Darwinism and the concept of Englishness - and its literary and social context.Angus Easson is at University of Salford.</p><h2>Contemporary Political Philosophy: An Anthology</h2><p>This authoritative collection of the seminal texts in post-war political philosophy has now been updated and expanded. <br> <ul> <li><br> </li> <li>Reprints key articles, mainly unabridged, touching upon the nature of the state, democracy, justice, rights, liberty, equality and oppression.<br> </li> <li>Includes work from politics, law and economics, as well as from continental and analytic philosophy.<br> </li> <li>Now includes thirteen additional texts, taking account of recent developments in the field and reflecting the most pressing concerns in international affairs.<br> </li> <li>Can be used alongside A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy (Blackwell Publishing, 1993; second edition in preparation) as the basis for a systematic introduction to the subject.</li> </ul></p><p>This monumental volume provides the most comprehensive and authoritative collection of the essential primary readings in post-war political philosophy.The anthology includes classic articles on the nature of the state, democracy, justice, rights, liberty, equality, and oppression.

This pioneering text explores the use of these concepts in the description of financial systems, the dynamic new specialty of econophysics. The authors illustrate the scaling concepts used in probability theory, critical phenomena, and fully-developed turbulent fluids and apply them to financial time series. They also present a new stochastic model that displays several of the statistical properties observed in empirical data. Physicists will find the application of statistical physics concepts to economic systems fascinating. Economists and other financial professionals will benefit from the book&#39;s empirical analysis methods and well-formulated theoretical tools that will allow them to describe systems composed of a huge number of interacting subsystems.</p><p>In recent years there has been a reciprocal interest between physicists and economists in finding common research approaches. This interest has been mainly triggered by the large amount of carefully recorded economic data now easily available, and by the emergence in physics of new results and paradigms in the study of critical phenomena, disordered systems and nonlinear dynamical systems. This book introduces the concepts and methods that are emerging from this renewed activity, in a straightforward direct style designed to appeal to individuals with either a science or economics background."Clearly and concisely written, this book provides an excellent introduction to the problem of understanding the empirical statistical properties of prices."

Of extraordinary philosophical, religious, and historical scope, it is the product of a great historian's lifetime of thought on the subject of his discipline and the human condition. While running counter to most of the accepted ideas and doctrines of our time, it offers a compelling framework for understanding history, science, and man's capacity for self-knowledge.<br>In this work, John Lukacs describes how we in the Western world have now been living through the ending of an entire historical age that began in Western Europe about five hundred years ago. Unlike people during the ending of the Middle Ages or the Roman empire, we can know where we are. But how and what is it that we know?</p><p>Selected by Choice as a 2003 Outstanding Academic Title&#34;The author tackles weighty matters, but he is a consistently engaging writer, and some of his sly asides are among the best parts of the book.&#34;-Michael Potemra, National Review; &#34;[Lukacs] is very much a voice worth listening to.&#34;-Jeet Heer, National Post (Canada); &#34;Perhaps no historian has a better right to take stock of our times-and of the state of historical thinking-than Lukacs. . . . A beautifully crafted and unforgettable book, one that every serious historian should read.&#34;-Choice</p><h2>The Curse of the Wise Woman (Valancourt 20th Century Classics)</h2><p>"Inventor of a new mythology and weaver of surprising folklore, Lord Dunsany stands dedicated to a strange world of fantastic beauty . . . unexcelled in the sorcery of crystalline singing prose, and supreme in the creation of a gorgeous and languorous world of incandescently exotic vision. No amount of mere description can convey more than a fraction of Lord Dunsany's pervasive charm." - H.P. Lovecraft <br><br> "There is a seam of memorable beauty running through the whole story." - Seamus Heaney, <i>The Listener</i> <br><br> "This story shows Lord Dunsany at his best. His imagination, and his mellifluous prose, are to be found in it; but more than most of his books it keeps its feet upon earth . . . it has the singular, melancholy charm of something solid and yet hazy, like the woods in autumn." - <i>Saturday Review</i> <br><br> "[N]o reader will forget the final wild scene . . . There is a strangeness and beauty and sorrow here, and all within a small and unobtrusive frame." - <i>Bookman</i> <br><br> After his father's interference in Irish politics ends with a band of killers arriving on Christmas night to assassinate him, young Charles Peridore finds himself master of the estate. During idyllic school holidays, Charles enjoys riding to hounds and hunting geese and snipe while his friend Tommy Marlin tells stories of Tir-nan-Og, the land of eternal youth that lies just beyond the bog. But when Progress arrives in the form of an English corporation determined to convert the landscape into factories and housing, it appears that an entire way of life is destined to vanish. Only one thing stands in the way: the sorcery of an old witch, whose curses the English workers do not even believe in. In the novel's unforgettable conclusion, the ancient powers of the wise woman will be pitted against the machinery of modern corporate greed, with surprising and thrilling results. <br><br> Lord Dunsany (1878-1957) is one of the most influential fantasy authors of the 20th century, counting H.P. Lovecraft, J.R.R. Tolkien, Michael Moorcock and Neil Gaiman among his many admirers. Regarded by many as his finest novel, <i>The Curse of the Wise Woman</i> (1933), a rich blend of fantasy, nostalgia and autobiography, returns to print for the first time in decades in this edition, which features a new introduction by Mark Valentine.</p><p></p><h2>Binding Passions: Tales of Magic, Marriage, and Power at the End of the Renaissance</h2><p>Mining the rich Venetian archives, especially the unusually detailed records of Venice's own branch of the Roman Inquisition, Guido Ruggiero provides a strikingly new and provocative interpretation of the end of the Renaissance in Italy. In this boldly structured work, he develops five narrative accounts of individual encounters with the Inquisition that illustrate the double-edged metaphor of how passions were both bound by late Renaissance society and were seen in turn as binding people. In this way new perspectives are opened on magic, witchcraft, love, marriage, gender, and discipline at the level of the community and beyond. Witches, courtesans, prostitutes, women healers, nobles, Cardinals, and renegade priests and monks speak from these pages describing their lives, beliefs, hopes, fears, and lies. With an imaginative flair for storytelling and impeccable scholarship, Ruggiero exposes the rich complexity of the culture and poetics of the everyday at the end of the Renaissance and illuminates a previously unexplored chapter in Italian history.<br></p><p>Guido Ruggiero is at University of Connecticut.<br>"This is a colorful book, lively, very teachable. It exposes beliefs and customs that only occasionally surface in the records of high culture, but clearly pullulated."--<em>Journal of Social History</em><p></p><br>"These tales introduce historians to a fascinating cast of characters, and historians of sexuality can find much of interest here."--<em>Journal of the History of Sexuality</em><p></p><br>"Good tales abound in this book...tales of the magical binding of love and lust within and without marriage, often across boundaries of class and status."--<em>Sixteenth Century Journal</em><p></p><br>"Ruggiero has interesting stories to tell. He draws out the implications of the stories without inflicting dreary theory on the reader. And he obviously knows his Venetian sources well."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"This imaginative work on the history of marriage, magic, witchcraft, and sexuality in the Republic of Venice in the late-sixteenth century offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of the 'illicit' through a series of carefully constructed 'dossiers' of the Inquisition. Guido Ruggiero has written an important and provocative book; his approach is novel; and the result is sure to engage a broad range of readers."--John Martin, Trinity University<p></p><br>"A fascinating account of women, gender, magic, and love in sixteenth-century Italy. Beautifully written and thought-provoking."--Dr. Susan Wabuda, Fordham University<p></p><br>"An excellent piece of 'microhistory' that offers some of the best insights we have into the role of magic in popular culture. First rate for students studying magic or witchcraft."--Steven Sargent, Union College<p></p><br>"Another stimulating and provocative study of the boundaries of behavior and belief in early modern Venice...This book will certainly be of interest not only to historians but also to literary scholars and art historians."--<em>Rivista Di Studi Italiani</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Complete Jewish Study Bible, Flexisoft (Imitation Leather, Blue, Indexed): Illuminating the Jewishness of God&#39;s Word</h2><p><p><i>The Complete Jewish Study Bible</i> pairs the updated text of the Complete Jewish Bible translation with extra study material, to help readers understand and connect with the<br> Jewish roots of the Christian faith.

The <i>Atlas of Western Art History</i> introduces a "cartographic approach to western art history" in which "maps explain the historical context of artistic developments, the rise of particular styles, the locations where individual artists worked, and the sites of thousands of important works of art." It is designed to be a "visual companion to narrative histories of art" rather than competing with such standard surveys as H. W. Janson's <i>History of Art</i>. Although the atlas has some shortcomings, it is a visually appealing publication that generally accomplishes its goals. Steer is professor emeritus of art history at London University, and White is professor of art history at the University of Calgary and Columbia University.<p>The atlas consists of about 150 two-page spreads on specific aspects of art history. Text appears on the left-hand page, with one or more thematic maps on the right. The essays were written by contributors who are listed, without credentials, in the front of the book. They are intended to "provide a general introduction to someone approaching each subject for the first time." Chapters are arranged chronologically from "The Greek World and its Colonies" (from the eighth to the fourth century B.C) to "American Art 1900-1950." They are distributed among five major sections corresponding to the traditional divisions of western art history. Each section begins with an introduction, one or more large colorplates, and several maps establishing the political context of the artistic developments of the period. For example, the three maps in the section "The Medieval World" depict "Byzantine Europe," "The Europe of Charlemagne," and "Europe in the Fourteenth Century." Most of the thematic maps fall into several categories: maps with symbols indicating types of artistic activity, site, or style (e.g., ivory carving, printing press, monastery); maps of cities or regions with locations of individual artists or monuments indicated; and maps with arrows tracing artistic exchange ("Art and Architecture in the Holy Land and its Influence on the West") or routes of materials ("Italian Art: Sources of Stone"). Small locator maps appear at the tops of the pages. The excellent illustrations--200 color and 100 black and white--often present less-familiar monuments rather than the best-known examples of the style or period.</p><p>Some chapters are more successful than others. The best are lucid overviews of complex subjects for the nonspecialist. "Cistercian Architecture," for example, provides an excellent introduction to this austere monastic style. The map indicates mother houses, affiliated houses, and outposts far from the order's French origins. Symbols on the map are easy to read, and the color photo of the Abbey Church of Senanque across a field of lavender is striking. The article will make nonspecialists want to learn more about Cistercian architecture. Unfortunately, readers will find no suggestions for further reading. The most successful maps present information that is not easily available graphically and with easily distinguishable colors and symbols. Most city maps ("Trecento Siena," "Venetian Architecture") fit this description, as do those tracing movements of artistic styles. In "Artists' Travels in the 17th Century," for example, an arrow from Naples to Malta represents Caravaggio's journey of 1607-08.</p><p>Other chapters will be less clear to the nonspecialist. "Art and Architecture from Constantine to Theodoric" refers to artworks as though the reader should already be familiar with them and without placing them geographically. The article "Early Medieval Ravenna" refers to a "peristyle courtyard," and the article "Viking Art" to "dendochronological studies," without explaining the terms. The use of colors and symbols is also problematic. Many maps use small symbols filled with subtle colors to indicate monuments, dates, or styles. "North Italian Architecture and Sculpture in the 15th and 16th Centuries," for example, uses numbered squares filled with pale yellow and green to indicate major architectural sites. Unfortunately, it is difficult to distinguish the colors. In "Medieval Secular Architecture," so many symbols for dates and types of architecture are clustered around Paris and London that it is difficult to tell which dates go with which types of architecture.</p><p>The atlas ends with an index to place names, artists, styles, and movements. Names of artworks are generally not included (e.g., Bear Run, Pennsylvania, is listed in the index, but not Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, although it is shown on the map and in a photograph). Text references are in regular type, maps in boldface, and illustrations in bold italic type.</p><p>The value of this innovative geographic approach to art history and the quality of most of the chapters more than compensate for the awkwardness of some maps and essays. The <i>Atlas of Western Art History</i> is recommended for academic and public libraries. <i></i></p>Art meets geography in this sure-to-be-popular title. Steer and White chart, more or less chronologically, the course of art history with brief topical essays and some 150 maps. Superimposed upon plain base maps (shortlines and rivers only, with too few key maps of the physical landscape) are a great variety of colors and geometric symbols relating to an artistic topic, time, and place. Many of the historical subjects covered are obvious ones, like the medieval pilgrimage routes and the expansion of Alexander the Great's empire. Others are quite novel and demonstrate the keen descriptive power of maps: the travels of individual masters during the Ren-aissance, for instance, and the widespread sources of raw materials in antiquity. Least effective are those devoted to American art, which amount to little more than lists of names lain atop a map. The authors wisely intend this to supplement rather than supplant the more standard surveys of art history. No doubt it will prove a richly useful resource for students and art aficionados alike.

This study delineates aspects previously unexplored in the history of liberalism as it is understood today. Examining sources heretofore neglected, Logue demonstrates the emergence in late 19th century France of a new liberalism that rejected laissez-faire economics and paved the way for the welfare-state liberalism of the 20th century. The emergence of this new liberalism was paralleled by a shift in the intellectual foundations of French liberalism from philosophy to sociology. Early 19th century French philosophy was dominated by the eclectics, followers of Victor Cousin, and From Philosophy to Sociology begins with a look at the political ideas of a group of eclectics: Adolphe Franck, Elme-Marie Caro, Paul Janet and Jules Simon. Separate chapters are devoted to two of the most original minds of the 19th century, Charles Renouvier and Alfre Fouillee. The tenets of liberalism and especially its relation to the development of public education at the beginning of the Third Republic are examined in connection with the work of two popularizers of liberalism, Ferdinand Buisson, and Gabriel Seailles. The relations of the emergent discipline of sociology to liberalism are then examined in the works of Alfred Espinas, Jean Izoulet and Gabriel Tarde. Finally, the liberalism of Emile Durkheim is analyzed and additionally illustrated by consideration of works of two Durkheimians, Celestin Bougle and Leon Duguit.

At Deitel &amp; Associates, we write programming language professional books and textbooks for publication by Prentice Hall, deliver programming languages corporate training courses at organizations worldwide and develop Internet businesses. This book is intended for programmers who do not yet know C++, and may or may not know object-oriented programming. </p> <p><b>Features of C++ for Programmers </b></p> <p>The Tour of the Book section of this Preface will give you a sense of <em>C++ for Programmers</em>&#x2019; coverage of C++ and object-oriented programming. Here&#x2019;s some key features of the book: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Early Classes and Objects Approach.</strong> We present object-oriented programming, where appropriate, from the start and throughout the text. </li> <li> <strong> Integrated Case Studies.</strong> We develop the GradeBook class in Chapters 3&#x2013;7, the Time class in several sections of Chapters 9&#x2013;10, the Employee class in Chapters 12&#x2013;13, and the optional OOD/UML ATM case study in Chapters 1&#x2013; 7, 9, 13 and Appendix E. </li> <li> <strong>Unified Modeling Language&#x2122; 2 (UML 2).</strong> The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has become the preferred graphical modeling language for designers of object-oriented systems. We use UML class diagrams to visually represent classes and their inheritance relationships, and we use UML activity diagrams to demonstrate the flow of control in each of C++&#x2019;s control statements. We emphasize the UML in the optional OOD/UML ATM case study </li> <li> <strong>Optional OOD/UML ATM Case Study.</strong> We introduce a concise subset of the UML 2, then guide you through a first design experience intended for the novice object-oriented designer/programmer. The case study was reviewed by a distinguished team of OOD/UML industry professionals and academics. The case study is not an exercise; rather, it&#x2019;s a fully developed end-to-end learning experience that concludes with a detailed walkthrough of the complete 877-line C++ code implementation. We take a detailed tour of the nine sections of this case study later in the Preface. </li> <li> <strong>Function Call Stack Explanation.</strong> In Chapter 6, we provide a detailed discussion (with illustrations) of the function call stack and activation records to explain how C++ is able to keep track of which function is currently executing, how automatic variables of functions are maintained in memory and how a function knows where to return after it completes execution. </li> <li> <strong>Class string.</strong> We use class string instead of C-like pointer-based char * strings for most string manipulations throughout the book. We include discussions of char * strings in Chapters 8, 10, 11 and 19 to give you practice with pointer manipulations, to illustrate dynamic memory allocation with new and delete, to build our own String class, and to prepare you for working with char * strings in C and C++ legacy code. </li> <li> <strong>Class Template vector. </strong>We use class template vector instead of C-like pointer-based array manipulations throughout the book. However, we begin by discussing C-like pointer-based arrays in Chapter 7 to prepare you for working with C and C++ legacy code and to use as a basis for building our own customized Array class in Chapter 11. </li> <li> <strong>Treatment of Inheritance and Polymorphism. </strong>Chapters 12&#x2013;13 include an Employee class hierarchy that makes the treatment of inheritance and polymorphism clear and accessible for programmers who are new to OOP. </li> <li> <strong>Discussion and Illustration of How Polymorphism Works &#x201c;Under the Hood.&#x201d;</strong> Chapter 13 contains a detailed diagram and explanation of how C++ can implement polymorphism, virtual functions and dynamic binding internally. This gives you a solid understanding of how these capabilities really work. More importantly, it helps you appreciate the overhead of polymorphism&#x2014;in terms of additional memory consumption and processor time. This helps you determine when to use polymorphism and when to avoid it. </li> <li> <strong>Standard Template Library (STL). </strong>This might be one of the most important topics in the book in terms of software reuse. The STL defines powerful, template-based, reusable components that implement many common data structures and algorithms used to process those data structures. Chapter 20 introduces the STL and discusses its three key components&#x2014;containers, iterators and algorithms. Using STL components provides tremendous expressive power, often reducing many lines of non-STL code to a single statement. </li> <li> I<strong>SO/IEC C++ Standard Compliance.</strong> We have audited our presentation against the most recent ISO/IEC C++ standard document for completeness and accuracy. Note: A PDF copy of the C++ standard (document number INCITS/ISO/ IEC 14882-2003) can be purchased at webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/ default.asp. </li> <li> <strong>Future of C++.</strong> In Chapter 21, which considers the future of C++, we introduce the Boost C++ Libraries, Technical Report 1 (TR1) and C++0x. The free Boost open source libraries are created by members of the C++ community. Technical Report 1 describes the proposed changes to the C++ Standard Library, many of which are based on current Boost libraries. The C++ Standards Committee is revising the C++ Standard. The main goals for the new standard are to make C++ easier to learn, improve library building capabilities, and increase compatibility with the C programming language. The last standard was published in 1998. Work on the new standard, currently referred to as C++0x, began in 2003. The new standard is likely to be released in 2009. It will include changes to the core language and, most likely, many of the libraries in TR1. We overview the TR1 libraries and provide code examples for the &#x201c;regular expression&#x201d; and &#x201c;smart pointer&#x201d; libraries. </li> <li> <strong>Debugger Appendices.</strong> We include two Using the Debugger appendices&#x2014; Appendix G, Using the Visual Studio Debugger, and Appendix H, Using the GNU C++ Debugger. </li> <li> <strong>Code Testing on Multiple Platforms.</strong> We tested the code examples on various popular C++ platforms. For the most part, the book&#x2019;s examples port easily to standard-compliant compilers. </li> <li> <strong>Errors and Warnings Shown for Multiple Platforms.</strong> For programs that intentionally contain errors to illustrate a key concept, we show the error messages that result on several popular platforms. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>All of this was carefully reviewed by distinguished industry developers and academics. We believe that this book will provide you with an informative, interesting, challenging and entertaining C++ educational experience. </p> <p>As you read this book, if you have questions, send an e-mail to deitel@deitel.com; we&#x2019;ll respond promptly.

The Deitels have taught courses at all levels to government, industry, military and academic clients of Deitel &amp; Associates. </p> <p> <em>Live-Code Approach.</em> C++ for Programmers is loaded with &#x201c;live-code&#x201d; examples&#x2014;by this we mean that each new concept is presented in the context of a complete working C++ application that is immediately followed by one or more actual executions showing the program&#x2019;s inputs and outputs. </p> <p> <em>Syntax Shading.</em> We syntax-shade all the C++ code, similar to the way most C++ integrated development environments (IDEs) and code editors syntax-color code. This greatly improves code readability&#x2014;an especially important goal, given that this book contains over 15,500 lines of code. Our syntax-shading conventions are as follows: </p> <em>comments appear in italic</em> <em> <strong>keywords appear in bold italic</strong> </em> <em> <strong>errors and ASP.NET script delimiters appear in bold black</strong> </em> constants and literal values appear in bold gray all other code appears in plain black <p> <em>Code Highlighting.</em> We place white rectangles around the key code segments in each program. </p> <p> <em>Using Fonts for Emphasis.</em> We place the key terms and the index&#x2019;s page reference for each defining occurrence in <em> <strong>bold italic</strong> </em> text for easier reference. We emphasize on-screen components in the <strong>bold Helvetica</strong> font (e.g., the File menu) and emphasize C++ program text in the Lucida font (e.g., int x = 5). </p> <p> <em>Web Access.</em> All of the source-code examples for <em>C++ for Programmers</em> are available for download from http://www.deitel.com/books/cppfp/. </p> <p> <em>Objectives.</em> Each chapter begins with a statement of objectives. This lets you know what to expect and gives you an opportunity, after reading the chapter, to determine if you&#x2019;ve met the objectives. </p> <p> <em>Quotations.</em> The learning objectives are followed by quotations. Some are humorous; some are philosophical; others offer interesting insights. We hope that you enjoy relating the quotations to the chapter material. </p> <p> <em>Outline.</em> The chapter outlines help you approach the material in a top-down fashion, so you can anticipate what is to come and set a comfortable and effective learning pace. </p> <p> <em>Illustrations/Figures.</em> Abundant charts, tables, line drawings, programs and program output are included. We model the flow of control in control statements with UML activity diagrams. UML class diagrams model the fields, constructors and methods of classes. We make extensive use of six major UML diagram types in the optional OOD/UML 2 ATM case study. </p> <p> <em>Programming Tips.</em> We include programming tips to help you focus on important aspects of program development. These tips and practices represent the best we&#x2019;ve gleaned from a combined seven decades of programming experience&#x2014;they provide a basis on which to build good software. </p> <blockquote> <p> <b>Good Programming Practice -</b> Good Programming Practices call attention to techniques that will help you produce programs that are clearer, more understandable and more maintainable. </p> <p> <b>Common Programming Error -</b> Pointing out these Common Programming Errors reduces the likelihood that you&#x2019;ll make the same mistakes. </p> <p> <b>Error-Prevention Tip -</b> These tips contain suggestions for exposing bugs and removing them from your programs; many describe aspects of C++ that prevent bugs from getting into programs in the first place. </p> <p> <b>Performance Tip -</b> These tips highlight opportunities for making your programs run faster or minimizing the amount of memory that they occupy. </p> <p> <b>Portability Tip -</b> We include Portability Tips to help you write code that will run on a variety of platforms and to explain how C++ achieves its high degree of portability. </p> <p> <b>Software Engineering Observation -</b> The Software Engineering Observations highlight architectural and design issues that affect the construction of software systems, especially large-scale systems. </p> </blockquote> <p> <em>Wrap-Up Section.</em> Each of the chapters ends with a brief &#x201c;wrap-up&#x201d; section that recaps the chapter content and transitions to the next chapter. </p> <p> <em>Thousands of Index Entries.</em> We&#x2019;ve included an extensive index which is especially useful when you use the book as a reference. </p> <p> <em>&#x201c;Double Indexing&#x201d; of C++ Live-Code Examples.</em> For every source-code program in the book, we index the figure caption both alphabetically and as a subindex item under &#x201c;Examples.&#x201d; This makes it easier to find examples using particular features. </p> <p><b>Tour of the Book </b></p> <p>You&#x2019;ll now take a tour of the C++ capabilities you&#x2019;ll study in C++ for Programmers. Figure 1 illustrates the dependencies among the chapters. We recommend studying the topics in the order indicated by the arrows, though other orders are possible. </p> <p> <strong>Chapter 1, Introduction,</strong> discusses the origin of the C++ programming language, and introduces a typical C++ programming environment. We walk through a &#x201c;test drive&#x201d; of a typical C++ application on the Windows and Linux platforms. We also introduce basic object technology concepts and terminology, and the Unified Modeling Language. </p> <p> <strong>Chapter 2, Introduction to C++ Programming,</strong> provides a lightweight introduction to programming applications in C++. The programs in this chapter illustrate how to display data on the screen, obtain data from the keyboard, make decisions and perform arithmetic operations. </p> <p> <strong>Chapter 3, Introduction to Classes and Objects,</strong> provides a friendly early introduction to classes and objects. We introduce classes, objects, member functions, constructors and data members using a series of simple real-world examples. We develop a well-engineered framework for organizing object-oriented programs in C++. We motivate the notion of classes with a simple example. Then we present a carefully paced sequence of seven complete working programs to demonstrate creating and using your own classes. These examples begin our integrated case study on developing a grade-book class that an instructor can use to maintain student test scores. This case study is enhanced over the next several chapters, culminating with the version presented in Chapter 7. The GradeBook class case study describes how to define a class and how to use it to create an object. The case study discusses how to declare and define member functions to implement the class&#x2019;s behaviors, how to declare data members to implement the class&#x2019;s attributes and how to call an object&#x2019;s member functions to make them perform their tasks. We introduce C++ Standard Library class string and create string objects to store the name of the course that a GradeBook object represents. We explain the differences between data members of a class and local variables of a function, and how to use a constructor to ensure that an object&#x2019;s data is initialized when the object is created. We show how to promote software reusability by separating a class definition from the client code (e.g., function main) that uses the class. We also introduce another fundamental principle of good software engineering&#x2014;separating interface from implementation. </p> <p>Fig. 1 C++ for Programmers chapter dependency chart. </p> <p> <strong>Chapter 4, Control Statements: Part 1,</strong> focuses on the program-development process involved in creating useful classes.

HarperSanFrancisco consistently chooses essays from the magazine for the &#34;Best Spiritual Writing&#34; series. It is located in New York City.Was there ever a better moment to be reminded that there is a wisdom that lives deep in the body, and that at that deepest level of human experience we are all connected? This fascinating collection of interviews with Joseph Campbell, the Dalai Lama, Elie Wiesel, Peter Brook, Oliver Sacks and others, conducted by Barrett and others on behalf of the distinguished quarterly of myth and tradition, does not supply easy or particularly quotable answers to the question of how to live rightly. According to Jungian analyst and author Helen Luke, becoming genuinely responsible for the state of the world demands that we learn to "live out our life stories with the utmost devotion to that which is not the ego but includes it." The ego must learn to be aware of the unconscious; that's old news. Yet when Luke emphasizes that we must learn to see our own small part, "our own little bit of darkness," even when we are very badly treated by others, the words realize new resonance. Each of the interviews here deepens and elaborates the theme of consciousness. There is much gold here, from the Jungian Marion Woodman, who describes how the "god" of greater awareness can enter through the "wound" of addiction, to the insights of neurologist Oliver Sacks, to the painter and philosopher William Segal, who movingly describes the silent communion that is the very highest level of both prayer and meditation. Although some readers may balk at a rather grandiose foreword by editor Barrett, those who persist will be rewarded with real food for thought. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Crystal Skulls: Ancient Tools for Peace, Knowledge, and Enlightenment</h2><p><p>Crystal skulls are human-skull hardstone carvings often made of clear or milky white quartz known as &#x201c;rock crystal.&#x201d; They are allegedly pre-Columbian Mesoamerican artifacts and can be found in the permanent collections of a number of world-class museums, including the Smithsonian and the British Museum.</p><p>In occult and metaphysical circles, the skulls have magical and healing qualities:<br></p><ul><li>Anna Mitchell-Hedges (owner of a particularly famous skull) claimed that the skull could cause visions and cure cancer and that its magical properties could be used to kill.</li><li>Drunvalo Melchizedek claims in <i>Serpent of Light that</i> he stumbled upon descendants of the ancient Mayans who possess crystal skulls for use in religious ceremonies in Yucatan temples.</li><li>Jamie Sams writes of the skulls&#x2019; association with Native American mythology.</li></ul><p></p><p>In this book, best-selling occultist and crystal expert Judy Hall provides a basic primer on crystal skulls:<br></p><ul><li>What they are</li><li>Where they are found</li><li>Their role in legend and lore around the world</li><li>Their uses for physical and psychic healing</li></ul><p></p><p>Also included here in this stunning introductory text is an examination of the prominent &#x201c;skull keepers&#x201d; of the past 100 years and how to use and communicate with a crystal skull.</p><p>This is a terrific book for those interested in occult and ancient mysteries and/or the power of gems and crystals.</p></p><p>A trained healer and counselor, <b>Judy Hall</b> has been psychic all her life and has had experience with many systems of divination and natural healing methods.

It synthesizes historical, ethnographic, and socioeconomic data within a social science framework., and places in proper context the region's distinctive &#x201c;way of life&#x201d; &#x2014;which has always been at the crossroads of cultures and civilizations. Comprehensive and straightforward coverage includes distinctive theoretical forms without the use of social science jargon.. <b> </b> Chapter topics include the prophet, religion, identity, and culture of Islam; communal identities and ethnic groups; pastoralism and nomadic society; agriculture and the changing village; cities and urban life; women and the social order; leadership, patronage, and tribalism as local organizations of power; and challenges and dilemmas facing the Middle East today. <b> </b> For individuals who want to explore problems, patterns, and cultural processes of the area known as the &#x201c;central Middle East.&#x201d; </p></p><p>Preface <p> This is the second edition of a book that has gone through more than twenty printings since its original publication in 1983. The unexpected vitality of the original edition was as pleasant as it was unexpected. In the normal course of events, reports about regions and people have a relatively short shelf life. The fact that the first edition has continued to be read indicates, to us at least, that there is a sense in which social scientific findings have a cumulative quality that goes beyond the fads of the moment. It would also seem that there is a need for scholarly reporting that is broadly accessible and relatively free from an overburden of scholarly jargon and theoretical minutiae. The first edition had this as an explicit goal, and to some extent at least, it seems that it was successful. We hope that this edition is equally useful. </p><p> This anthropological essay builds on nearly three decades of teaching and research by both authors in various countries of the Middle East and in neighboring regions in Africa, the Balkans, and Central Asia. As friends and colleagues of long standing, we have maintained an ongoing dialogue about the craft of anthropology and what it offers the student of Middle Eastern society. Our different but complementary points of departure and field experiences have helped, we feel, to make our discussions particularly fruitful. This book has no senior author. Indeed, it would not be possible to attribute any passage or section to any one of us; the venture was truly collaborative in all respects. In the first edition the actual, sometimes tedious, process of writing and revising was done in joint sessions; in this edition we had relatively brief but intensive sessions of joint work, but the actual crafting of chapters was necessarily done while working on separate continents, with Bates often in Turkey and Rassam in New York. </p><p> As the title suggests, we see this book as an exercise in social anthropology. To that extent, our objectives are to provide a synthesis of what we feel our discipline has been able to contribute to an understanding of this important area of the world. We have avoided theoretical polemics and specialized jargon in the hopes of avoiding a common social science tendency to mystify and thereby to explain less than is already known by common sense. </p><p> Our point of departure&#x2014;in fact, the assumption underlying the analysis we provide&#x2014;is that explanations of cultural institutions and social processes must be relatable to the behavior of individuals, their needs, values, and motivations. Individual decisions and actions, indeed, behavior of all sorts, take place in the context of particular social or cultural settings. These social and cultural settings are themselves shaped by the momentum of a specific history. Not only do the material constraints of the moment affect the strategies of individuals today, but the particular ways in which material problems or opportunities were handled in the past also influence current choices. </p><p> Systems of values, norms, and religious beliefs are also an integral part of social process. Not only does an ideational system give meaning to individuals' actions, but the system itself is a source of constraints facing the individual and society, as well as an arena in which people compete. Individuals and groups use ideologies of all sorts as they strive for power&#x2014;to control resources, gain prestige, and influence outcomes. Although we have not paid great attention to national-level politics and economics, we have consistently kept this larger and important context in view as we developed our analysis. It would not be too much to say that a full understanding of the activities of people in the most remote village today requires an awareness of how that community fits into a national, indeed, a world economic and political system. </p><p> Many people are to be thanked for the assistance they have rendered us directly or indirectly Both of us were students of William Schorger at the University of Michigan at critical junctures of our intellectual growth. To him we express that special thanks due to one's teachers. We also want to acknowledge our special intellectual debt to Eric Wolf, who as teacher, friend, critic, and colleague, stimulated and challenged us over many years. In fact, at the outset of this enterprise, we took as a model his early book, Sons of the Shaking Earth, which describes the cultural history of the valley of Mexico. To us, this book exemplifies a superb treatment of a complex historical and cultural tradition, a treatment at once elegant, sympathetic, and honest. </p><p> Of the many friends and colleagues who assisted us by the critical reading of parts of the present manuscript, we would like to thank Ayse Alalin, Alan Duben, David Gilmore, Greg Johnson, Ugur Komecoglu, Luci Saunders, Aseel Sawalha, Ali Murat Yel, Judith Tucker, and at least two anonymous but very constructive readers. Luci Saunders, a friend of long standing, was especially encouraging and thoughtful in urging this revision at a time when the undertaking was languishing. Ron and Nancy Adams, Goble Messer, and Joe Morris provided much needed help to Bates while he was ignoring his family and neighborly obligations. Ulku Ulkusal, Marc de Clercq, Jonathon Shanon, Aseel Sawalha, Caglar Keyder, and Harald Skogseid kindly made available photos for use. Three colleagues at Istanbul Bilgi University, Arus Yumul, Alan Duben, and Ugur Komecoglu, were especially generous in sharing their time and thoughts. Among other colleagues at Bilgi University, Didem Danis, Duygun Erim, and Aybike Hatemi were unfailing in their practical and moral support. </p><p> One person deserves special acknowledgment. Judith Tucker read the entire manuscript not once but at several stages, and offered detailed suggestions for its intellectual coverage and for improvement of the manuscript both in terms of content and in presentation. Her contribution is greatly appreciated. Two other individuals worked closely with us during the final four months during which we struggled to bring many pieces together. Christina Mitrakos, our research assistant in New York working out of Hunter College with Bates and Rassam, sought out books and other sources, gathered data for several of the chapters, and prepared the figures and tables and the bibliography. Aye Akalm, working with Bates in Istanbul, also provided numerous sources, gathered a wealth of data and downloaded material from the Internet. Both, we are confident, will go on to fine careers in the social sciences. We also wish to acknowledge the helpful comments provided by the following individuals who reviewed the original manuscript for Prentice Hall: William Irons of Northwestern University and Charles L. Redman of Arizona State. Kathleen Borowik prepared all maps, for which we are grateful. All photographs not otherwise credited were supplied by the authors. </p><p> The system of transliteration generally used is that recommended by The International Journal of Middle Eastern Studies.

It is published in two complementary parts: <br>&nbsp; <br><strong><em>the book, </em></strong>which contains a unified treatment of the theory of the public sector along with selected examples. <br>&nbsp; <br><strong><em>the companion website</em></strong> (included in the price of the book), which features a large international Public Sector Example Bank, written and updated by Richard Tresch and tied to specific sections in the book. <br>&nbsp; <br>This innovative solution to the challenge of conveying the fundamentals of such a wide-ranging field allows students the best of both worlds: a readable, concise, and penetrating account of public sector theory, along with an evolving set of up-to-date examples that makes the theory come alive.&nbsp;</p><p>RICHARD W. TRESCH&nbsp;is Professor in the Department of Economics, Boston College, USA. He is author of <em>Public Finance: A Normative Theory</em> (Academic Press) and <em>Principles of Economics</em> (Thompson). His abilities as a teacher were recognized by the award of the Massachusetts Teacher of the Year from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.<p>&#x201c;Richard Tresch's graduate textbook, <i>Public Finance, A Normative Theory </i>is now the standard reference for graduate courses in public economics.&nbsp;He has now written an equally impressive textbook for use in undergraduate courses in public economics. His writing is clear, informative, and illuminating, and the&nbsp;text contains many new and useful insights. I look forward to using it in my own classes.&#x201d; --<i>Professor James Alm, Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Georgia State University, Editor of Public Finance Review </i></p><p>"This is a terrific book. It makes much of the material in Tresch's former graduate textbook available to undergraduate students, adding a good balance between the fundamental theoretical perspectives and real life policy issues."--<i>Jorge Martinez-Vazquez, Professor of Economics and Director of International Studies, Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Georgia State University<br></i><br>"This text provides a detailed, and yet clear and refreshingly systematic, treatment of most of the major issues in modern public economics. It will be a very useful, up-to-date resource for students as well as researchers and policy practitioners." - <i>Dr Miltiadis Makris, University of Leicester</i><br></p><p>"The great strength of this book is its unifying framework, with a maximum use of graphical illustrations and a minimal use of mathematics, whilst maintaining a high level of rigour. It will work excellent in teaching students the basic issues and problems in public sector economics and to train them to think as an economist." - <i><i>Loek Groot, Associate Professor, Utrecht University, The&nbsp;Netherlands</i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Tresch&#x2019;s Public Sector Economics provides a thorough treatment of the field in a way that is less daunting for students taking an undergraduate course. He clearly explains the core topics in public expenditure theory and policy, and in tax theory and policy. And the text also introduces the emergent field known as behavioural public sector economics. But probably the most appealing feature in Tresch&#x2019;s book is that it provides detailed examples illustrating real-life issues via an internet site, in effect lifting the space constraint limiting such expositions in printed texts. I foresee that students and teachers will welcome this innovative way of explaining how to use the tools for the economic analysis of government." -Jos� Sanchez Fung</p></p><h2>Christian Moderns: Freedom and Fetish in the Mission Encounter (Volume 1) (The Anthropology of Christianity)</h2><p>Across much of the postcolonial world, Christianity has often become inseparable from ideas and practices linking the concept of modernity to that of human emancipation. To explore these links, Webb Keane undertakes a rich ethnographic study of the century-long encounter, from the colonial Dutch East Indies to post-independence Indonesia, among Calvinist missionaries, their converts, and those who resist conversion. Keane&#39;s analysis of their struggles over such things as prayers, offerings, and the value of money challenges familiar notions about agency. Through its exploration of language, materiality, and morality, this book illuminates a wide range of debates in social and cultural theory. It demonstrates the crucial place of Christianity in semiotic ideologies of modernity and sheds new light on the importance of religion in colonial and postcolonial histories.</p><p>"Webb Keane's book demonstrates, once again, that nothing illuminates the puzzles of modernity as effectively as cross-cultural studies of colonial encounters. His careful, interdisciplinary, and penetrating analysis of the semiotics of conversion to Dutch Calvinism in the Indonesian island of Sumba and his skillful blending of theological and anthropological issues will make this book a model for studies of religious conversion. It truly deserves a wide readership."&#x2015;Dipesh Chakrabarty, author of <i>Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Christian Moderns</i> is a wonderful exploration of the boundaries between material things, words, and agents, and the implications of their separation and interconnection for the master trope of modernity. In a rich and challenging analysis, . . . the book shows how a Christian modernity was negotiated and inhabited. The elaborate care with which Keane argues this thesis is truly impressive. I do not know of any other anthropological book on the same theme that can compare with it.&#x201d;&#x2015;Talal Asad, author of <i>Genealogies of Religion: Discipline and Reasons of Power in Christianity and Islam</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Christian Moderns</i> is the kind of book every anthropologist would like to have written. Keane moves easily between the large and small picture: modernism, purification, and Protestantism; a religious conversion or the changing value of meat on the Indonesian island of Sumba. In developing a semiotic ideology, he is able to address at once verbal and material culture, ritual speech and exchange, innerness and sincerity, agency, intentionality and fetishism, and the mutual misrecognitions of the missionary and the &#x2018;pagan.&#x2019; I know of no book that is as sensitive to the embedded, the spiritual, conundra, of religious contact and conversion and yet remains rigorous in argument.&#x201d;&#x2015;Vincent Crapanzano, author of <i>Serving the Word: Literalism in America from the Pulpit to the Bench</i><br><br>&#x201c;In this remarkable work, Webb Keane juxtaposes European religious disputes with an ethnographic account of Christian conversion in Indonesia. Abiding dilemmas of western social science&#x2015;he argues&#x2015;have their source in language ideologies that anthropologists share with the Protestant missionaries who preceded them. Anxieties about objectification, agency, and the erasure of materiality have been crucial to Calvinism. They are no less central to colonial modernization projects and our own logics of inquiry. In lucid prose, Keane builds a powerful argument about semiosis and material life that is sure to stimulate important debate.&#x201d;&#x2015;Susan Gal, co-author of <i>The Politics of Gender After Socialism</i><b>Webb Keane</b> is Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan.

The author is particularly keen to highlight the work of authors whom he feels have been largely neglected by literary criticism. Hence he covers dramatists such as Shadwell, Lee, Otway and Southerne and authors such as John Banks, Mrs Behn, Crowne, Durfey and Ravenscroft. The book also looks at Restoration preachers, historians, biographers, essayists, poets and eccentrics such as John Aubrey and Walter Pope. Despite the book&#39;s clear literary bias, it does not ignore men of science, politics and economics. Of particular interest during the Restoration period is the development of literary criticism in its very early stages, and the author examines the implications of this development for literature as a whole.</p><p></p><h2>The Lady Vanishes &amp; the Spiral Staircase (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>This novel, when originally published in 1936, was entitled The Wheel Spins.

It serves as both an introduction to American politics and to the discipline of political science by reflecting the theoretical developments and empirical inquiry conducted by researchers. Every chapter highlights the most current research and discusses related public policy. It demonstrates for students how to think critically and analytically, bringing theoretical insight to contemporary American politics.</p> <p>More than just a comprehensive overview and description of how American politics works, Jon Bond and Kevin Smith demonstrate how politics can be studied systematically. Throughout the text, they introduce students to the insights gleaned from rational choice, behavioral, and biological approaches to politics. Understanding these three social scientific models and their applications helps students get the most out of their American government course and out of this text--they learn a way of thinking that they can use to make sense of future challenges facing the American polity. </p> <p>A number of features help aid comprehension and critical thinking: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Key Questions </strong>at the start of every chapter frame the learning objectives and concepts</li> <li><strong>Politics in Practice</strong> boxes in every chapter encourage students to think critically about how practice compares with theory</li> <li><strong>Tables, Figures, Charts, </strong>and <strong>Maps </strong>throughout present the empirical details of American politics, helping students gain quantitative literacy</li> <li><strong>Top Ten Takeaway Points</strong> at the end of every chapter recap the most important points covered but also help students discern the general principles that make sense of the numerous factual details</li> <li><strong>Key Terms </strong>are bolded in the text, defined in the margins, recapped at the end of the chapter, and compiled in a glossary, all to help insure that students can effortlessly master the vocabulary of American politics and political science in order to move on to the more important concepts. </li></ul></p><p><b> </b><p><b>Jon R.

The skills and approaches outlined are derived from Roger&#39;s work in schools as a consultant and from his mentor-teaching in challenging schools. This is a major revision of the second edition and covers: establishing classes effectively and positive discipline practice in the classroom working with children with behavioural disorders developing individual behaviour plans managing anger and conflict working with the challenging and hard-to-manage classes effective colleague support. Bill Rogers is undoubtedly the international guru of behaviour management. Although based in Australia, he spends at least 3 months of the year in the UK, running workshops and training for schools and universities.</p><p>After years of teaching, Bill Rogers now works as a consultant, specialising in discipline, classroom management and teacher stress, and is the author of a number of successful books including Managing Teacher Stress, also published by Pearson.&#34;Foundational to Rogers&#39; approach is the interplay of rights and responsibilities within the school context. Any teacher who reads this book knows that Rogers is sympathetic to their profession; through personal anecdotes, gentle humour and clearheaded analysis of classroom dynamics, he aptly describes the challenges presented by a roomful of diverse and sometimes disruptive students. However, he makes crystal clear from the start that teaching is about respect and fairness. School should be a safe place for children. It is only within this relationship of rights and responsibilities that real learning can take place. Written for teacher practitioners, this text will also be of interest to teachers-in-training and some parents. I suggest that, as well as being a useful staffroom resource, this book could form the basis of more structured staff discussions around issues of discipline and behaviour management.&#34; - Janet Whitten, Australian Journal of Dyslexia and Specific Learning Difficulties &#34;Bill Rogers has gained wide respect through his work as a consultant running in-service activities for teachers on classroom and whole-school discipline approaches. You Know the Fair Rule provides the depth of discussion and detail required to understand and implement Rogers&#39; strategies. How many of us have consciously planned how to respond to specific disruptive behaviour, such as students calling out or farting? Through detailed and realistic descriptions and discussions of classroom situations, Rogers builds up a wide repertoire of possible teacher actions. Throughout the book, Rogers exhibits a compassionate understanding of the difficulties faced by teachers � who have &#39;one of the most demanding of all jobs&#39;. This book could (and should) usefully form the basis for teacher training programs on discipline. For those of us in the classroom � from kindergarten to secondary schools � it provides practical strategies for less stressful and more effective classes (and schools) for both students and teachers.&#34; - Joy Kite, Education Quarterly &#34;Bill Rogers&#39; You Know the Fair Rule is a very practical document; one can imagine a harassed teacher hastily consulting a relevant section before facing a difficult class. At the same time, the book is a logical text which deserves leisurely and thoughtful digestion. The writing is relaxed without being colloquial, informative without being didactic. The text is set under clear headings and often expressed in point form, clarified by use of diagrams and flow charts and enlivened by Kevin Burgemeestre&#39;s humorous line drawings. This book is, I feel, compulsory reading for all educators.&#34; - Anna Abbott, Sydney Morning Herald &#34;Rogers is no starry-eyed idealist and has obviously confronted many of the situations he describes. He is firm on the essential importance of respecting all students, no matter how unlikeable their behaviour may be, and he is actually able to define respect in operational terms. As a teacher working exclusively with &#39;at risk&#39; or &#39;disinclined&#39; students, I can endorse his views. The section on the need for self-esteem should be read by all teachers.&#34; - Sue Nichols, Bowden Brompton Community School &#34;The author knows what he is writing about from personal experience and is essentially practical in dealing with the problems we face in our classrooms every day. This is a most highly recommended book for all involved in teaching. Many teachers will want a personal copy but every school should have a copy in its Professional Development library if it is serious about its discipline policy.&#34; - Derek Robson, Staff Development Association Journal &#34;Rogers uses many examples that are easy to relate to and highlights differences and alternatives that could be used for any class from kinder through to high school. I recognised many different teacher reactions and realised how easy it is to establish more succinct and accepted behaviour management strategies in any class. I found this book to be very &#39;reader friendly&#39; and accessible, making it a must-read for beginning teachers or those needing some inspiration to make their classroom more equitable and learning focused.&#34; - Charlie White, AEU, Ed.

First published by British abolitionists in 1788, it exposed this widespread commercial practice for what it really was--shocking, immoral, barbaric, unimaginable. Printed as handbills and broadsides, the image Cheryl Finley has termed the "slave ship icon" was easily reproduced, and by the end of the eighteenth century it was circulating by the tens of thousands around the Atlantic rim. <i>Committed to Memory</i> provides the first in-depth look at how this artifact of the fight against slavery became an enduring symbol of black resistance, identity, and remembrance.</p><p>Finley traces how the slave ship icon became a powerful tool in the hands of British and American abolitionists, and how its radical potential was rediscovered in the twentieth century by black artists, activists, writers, filmmakers, and curators. Finley offers provocative new insights into the works of Amiri Baraka, Romare Bearden, Betye Saar, and many others. She demonstrates how the icon was transformed into poetry, literature, visual art, sculpture, performance, and film&#x2015;and became a medium through which diasporic Africans have reasserted their common identity and memorialized their ancestors.</p><p>Beautifully illustrated, <i>Committed to Memory</i> features works from around the world, taking readers from the United States and England to West Africa and the Caribbean. It shows how contemporary black artists and their allies have used this iconic eighteenth-century engraving to reflect on the trauma of slavery and come to terms with its legacy.</p></p><p><p> "An original and brilliantly conceived account of how the horrors of the transatlantic trade in human cargo have been visualized in art and culture over more than two centuries. Finley has written a nuanced and provocative book that leaves an imprint on one's mind as indelible as the slave ship icon itself."<b>--Kellie Jones, author of <i>EyeMinded: Living and Writing Contemporary Art</i></b></p><p>"Stimulating and insightful. Finley hones in on the cultural and political strategies that have animated and illustrated the impact of the Atlantic slave trade."<b>--Deborah Willis, author of <i>Posing Beauty: African American Images from the 1890s to the Present</i></b></p><b>Cheryl Finley</b> is associate professor of art history at Cornell University.

Luciana Jacobelli reveals the latest evidence on the best-documented categories of gladiators, their origins, social status, equipment, and training. Originally staged for the funeral rights of prominent Roman citizens, gladiatorial games eventually became a tool for career politicians to both gain popularity and appease the often turbulent masses. While most gladiators were slaves or prisoners of war forced into a career of battle, others were criminals or free men from prominent families who aspired to fame and fortune. Surprisingly, there are even records of women gladiators.<br> <em>Gladiators at Pompeii</em> offers a riveting account of the lives and exploits of these Roman warriors, who continue to capture and enthrall the popular imagination today.</p><p>Luciana Jacobelli specializes in archaeology at the University of Rome &#34;La Sapienza&#34; and works at the Superintendency of Pompeii.</p><h2>Mechanics of Fluids</h2><p>Gain an understanding of fluid mechanics and the ability to analyze this important phenomena encountered by practicing engineers with MECHANICS OF FLUIDS, 5E.

Dr. Ramadan is a member of ASEE, ASME, ACS, and SAE."There are many learning benefits to this textbook, viz. Key Concepts, Margin definitions, Fundamentals of Engineering problem section. However, the unique approach that Drs. Potter and Wiggert take to breakdown complex concepts of fluid mechanics and provide an easy to follow and succinate textbook is amazing. The authors have done an exceptional job in assembling a comprehensive textbook. One of the strongest attributes of this textbook is the addition of FE/EIT exam examples. The authors do not teach to the FE exam, but rather enhance their product with the addition of these examples. Without question, these two (Drs. Potter and Wiggert) are the exemplary instructors that every engineering college envisions. The highlights of "key concepts" and margin definition are a benefit for both student and instructor. This is a difficult topic from many lower-division engineering students. The presentation by the authors is the most comprehensive yet straightforward approach I have seen to date. Readability and presentation of complex concepts is a true strength of this textbook."<br><br>"I like it (the level of presentation). The students appear to like it. The boxes in the margins are nice in that they point out the key concepts. I use the book in my class and have used it for a number of years."<br><br>"The text is written at a level that provides more than adequate materials for the very good students and "required" basics for the average student. Progression in presenting the topics and sections of chapters is smooth. The text is balanced in exposing theoretical materials followed by examples/illustrations. Texts in fluids mechanics have evolved over many years to do this and this text does a great job of this. Examples and their frequency/breadth of coverage is appropriate. The problem-solving methodology in the examples is done extremely well. Illustrations are very well done."</p><h2>Chloe Plus Olivia: An Anthology of Lesbian and Bisexual Literature from the 17th Century to the Present</h2><p>Combining the works of four centuries of lesbian and bisexual writers, by Willa Cather, Gertrude Stein, Carson McCullers, and others, a collection reviews the shifting concept of &#34;lesbian literature&#34; by exploring six different genres. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>This hefty assemblage of poetry, fiction, journals and correspondence from more than 75 women and men charts the evolution of the lesbian psyche and lesbian fictional characters through four centuries. Grouping her material into six sections, Faderman ( Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers ) first examines the concept of romantic friendship between women, as in Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market." She acknowledges the importance of male thought on perceptions of lesbianism, using case studies by Krafft-Ebing and Freud; literary examples include Radclyffe Hall's correspondence, Vita Sackville-West's journals and a Willa Cather story. The most entertaining section explores the "carnivorous flowers," literature of exotic and evil lesbians. Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 lesbian vampire novella, "Carmilla," is juxtaposed against an excerpt from Jewelle Gomez's The Gilda Stories . The book's fourth part examines the literature of lesbian encoding, created by women who hid their sexual thoughts in the voices of male characters or with "bearded" pronouns: authors included under this rubric are Gertrude Stein, Katherine Mansfield, Virginia Woolf, H.D., Carson McCullers, May Sarton and Jane Bowles. The next section charts the rise of the lesbian feminist voice in the '60s and '70s and features pieces by Rita Mae Brown and Joanna Russ. Sarah Schulman's witty "The Penis Story" highlights the final section, in which Faderman charts the course of "post-lesbian-feminist literature" into more explicitly sexual territory, with many pieces from minority writers. Faderman's notes are indispensable. There will be debate over the choice of selections, however; Faderman admits that many of her chosen authors wouldn't have considered themselves lesbian. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Editor Faderman is no charlatan striving to pass off pre-twentieth-century writers as lesbian in the modern sense. For example, she explains that the seventeenth-century poet Katharine Fowler Philips, who wrote very passionately, indeed, to and about her female friends, was called by her contemporaries the English Sappho solely to compliment her poetic ability; further, Faderman points out that, in Philips' time, the prevalent myth about Sappho's love life had to do with her supposed suicide over a young male sailor. Because of such scrupulousness, this massive historical anthology finds room for writings by men about women's romantic friendship, sexual psychology (excerpts from Krafft-Ebing and Freud), and evil lesbian sexuality (Baudelaire and Sheridan LeFanu's famous vampire novella Carmilla). But not surprisingly, most of the contents, which include personal letters as well as poetry and fiction, come from this century; for manageability, they are the work of English and American writers only (Monique Wittig, French but long resident in the U.S., is the sole exception). A most intelligent and absorbing collection that fills a gap among historic literary surveys. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Semantics</h2><p>The third edition of this popular textbook provides an engaging and accessible introduction to semantics for students new to the field. <ul> <li>Explores the basic concepts and methods of the field and discusses some of the most important contemporary lines of research</li> <li>Contains new solutions to chapter exercises in order to familiarize the student with the practice of semantic description</li> <li>Completely revised and updated to reflect recent theoretical developments</li> <li>Includes new sections on classifiers and noun classes, as well as conceptual integration</li> </ul></p><p>This book provides an engaging introduction to semantics for students new to the field.

While many people are familiar with this prestigious award, relatively few are acquainted with the English illustrator after whom it was named. Randolph Caldecott was one of the most popular book illustrators of the late nineteenth century. His picture books were issued two at a time every Christmas, from 1878 until his death in 1886. He chose the subjects on his own, drawing from a mix of age-old nursery rhymes, pieces by eighteenth-century writers, and nonsense he made up himself.<br><br>With their humorous wordplay and exquisite illustrations, Caldecott's picture books continue to engage the imaginations of children and adults alike. This new edition reproduces nine of his most popular stories: <i>The House that Jack Built, The Diverting History of John Gilpin, Sing a Song for Sixpence, The Three Jovial Huntsmen, The Farmer's Boy, The Queen of Hearts, The Milkmaid, Hey Diddle Diddle, </i>and <i>Baby Bunting. </i><br><br>This book is the third in the series of Huntington Library Children's Classics, which include facsimiles of favorite children's books from the Huntington's rare book collections.</p><p>Randolph Caldecott's Picture Books "Caldecott's work heralds the beginning of the modern picture book."&#x2014;Maurice Sendak</p><h2>Elementary Number Theory</h2><p><i>Elementary Number Theory</i>, Sixth Edition, is written for the one-semester undergraduate number theory course taken by math majors, secondary education majors, and computer science students.

Yet despite unreserved agreement on the importance of this cultural moment, previous studies often reductively distort our reading of the formation of early twentieth-century lesbian identity, either by neglecting to examine in detail the developments leading up to the ban or by framing events in too broad a context against other cultural phenomena. <br><br><i>Fashioning Sapphism</i> locates the novelist Radclyffe Hall and other prominent lesbians&#x2015;including the pioneer in women's policing, Mary Allen, the artist Gluck, and the writer Bryher&#x2015;within English modernity through the multiple sites of law, sexology, fashion, and literary and visual representation, thus tracing the emergence of a modern English lesbian subculture in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Drawing on extensive new archival research, the book interrogates anew a range of myths long accepted without question (and still in circulation) concerning, to cite only a few, the extent of homophobia in the 1920s, the strategic deployment of sexology against sexual minorities, and the rigidity of certain cultural codes to denote lesbianism in public culture.</p><p>An in-depth study of early 20th century social conditions and cultural trends in Britain that constructed the popular image of the &#34;modern lesbian&#34;Laura Doan is professor of English at SUNY Geneseo.

Her career spanned nearly seventy-five years and included work in her native France as well as in Africa, South America, Asia, and Europe, and today her designs are highly collectable. Recently, several hundred photographic negatives were uncovered in her archives, revealing for the first time the scope of her work as a photographer. In the late 1920s, French interior and furniture designer Charlotte Perriand was at the cusp of her career, just beginning her work as an architect, designer, town planner, and political militant. Starting in 1927, she turned to photography, which was to play a pivotal role in her development as a designer through the pioneering years of the modern movement. Her photographic venture ended in Japan in 1941, when the hope of a better world was shattered by World War II. For Charlotte Perriand, photography was a machine for thinking, taking notes, and stirring emotions, but it was also an instrument of political engagement. Today, her photographs are a revelation, offering unseen glimpses into her creative process and intellectual development. Her photographs express the important themes and questions explored by modern artists of the day, and are part of the vast stream of avant-garde movements in which painters, architects, and photographers - and sometimes all three combined - worked together in a common spirit.</p><p>Jacques Barsac has made some forty documentaries on art and historical subjects, winning twenty prizes in international festivals, including a silver medal from the Acad�mie d&#39;Architecture. With this book, which follows his Charlotte Perriand. Un art d&#39;habiter (2006), he continues to explore the work of this pioneer in the twentieth-century modern movement. Fran�ois Cheval, sociologist, anthropologist and great expert in the world of photography, is the director of Mus�e Nic�phore Ni�pce in Chalon-sur Sa�ne, a temple of photography dedicated to the one who invented it in 1816. Alfred Paquement, curator of Monumenta 2008, has been the director of the Mus�e national d&#39;art moderne Centre Pompidou since September 2000.</p><h2>Pedro: The Angel of Olvera Street</h2><p>This Caldecott Honor book from beloved children's book author Leo Politi, originally published in 1946, is set on Olvera Street, the site of Los Angeles' original Latino settlement, which is still preserved very much as it once was--a busy and colorful me'lange of small artisan shops, restaurants, and strolling musicians.<br> <br><em>Pedro</em> tells of the community's Christmas tradition of the "posada," a procession that reenacts Mary and Joseph's pilgrimage to Bethlehem, and of the "pi�ata," a papier-m�ch� vessel filled with toys that children break open at the Posada's end. Pedro hopes to find a music box among the toys that will spill out of the pi�ata. But first, he is asked to don the red wings of an angel and lead the procession. Because he not only is costumed like an angel but also sings like one, he is asked to lead the chorus in the traditional Posada song. Music and lyrics for the song are included, and with them children may create their own Posada pageant.</p><p><br><strong>Leo Politi</strong> wrote and illustrated dozens of children's books, many of which are set in the Latino communities of Southern California. He won the Caldecott Medal for his book <em>Song of the Swallows</em>, first published in 1948.<br></p><h2>Flora of the Santa Cruz Mountains of California: A Manual of the Vascular Plants</h2><p><p>The Santa Cruz Mountains, an area covering almost 1,400 square miles from San Francisco southward to the Monterey County line, are a part of the Coast Range of Central California. The Mountains and the adjacent lowlands have a rich vascular flora, and about 1,800 species, subspecies, varieties, forms, and hybrids of ferns, conifers, and flowering plants, distributed among 168 families, have been reported from the region. This comprehensive flora, the first of the area, is designed for use by both the serious beginner and the trained botanist.</p> <p>The flora is illustrated by 250 line drawing and ten photographs. In addition, there is a map of the Santa Cruz Mountains area and a stratigraphic profile of the rock formations. The stratigraphic profile and a section on geology have been contributed by Dr. Earl E. Brabb of the United States Geological Survey. </p> <p>Distributional notes, keys to families, genera, and species, pertinent synonymy, a glossary of technical terms, an index of place names, and common0name and scientific-name indexes form the body of the text. The Introduction contains a description of the geography of the Santa Cruz Mountains and adjacent lowlands, seconds on the geology and climate, a brief discussion and analysis of the vegetation and floristic affinities of the area, and a history of past botanical collecting. A selected list of references has been appended to allow the interested individual to pursue his studies further.</p></p><p>John Hunter Thomas is Assistant Curator of the Dudley Herbarium at Stanford University."The treatment of the flora is remarkably comprehensive with excellent keys to the major plant groups, families, genera, and species.

Yet an honest consideration reveals a history marred by great crimes and ordinary errors, alongside many achievements and triumphs. In this comprehensive account of American foreign relations from the nation&#x2019;s founding through the present day, the diplomatic historian Warren I. Cohen calls attention to the uses&#x2015;and abuses&#x2015;of U.S. international leadership and the noble as well as the exploitative ends that American power has wrought.<br><br>In <i>A Nation Like All Others</i>, Cohen offers a brisk, argumentative history that confronts the concept of American exceptionalism and decries the lack of moral imagination in American foreign policy. He begins with the foreign policy of colonial and postrevolutionary America, exploring interactions with European powers and Native Americans and the implications of slavery and westward expansion. He then traces the rise of American empire; the nation&#x2019;s choices leading up to and in the wake of the First World War; and World War II and renewed military involvement in foreign affairs. Cohen provides a long history of the Cold War, from its roots under Truman through the Korean and Vietnam Wars to the transformation of the international system under Reagan and Gorbachev. Finally, he surveys America&#x2019;s recent history in the Middle East, with particular attention to the mismanagement of the War on Terror and Abu Ghraib. Written with great depth of knowledge and moral clarity, <i>A Nation Like All Others</i> suggests that an unflinching look at the nation&#x2019;s past is America&#x2019;s best option to shape a better future.</p><p>Warren I. Cohen is Distinguished University Professor Emeritus at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. His Columbia University Press books include <i>East Asian Art and American Culture </i>(1992), <i>East Asia at the Center: Four Thousand Years of Engagement with the World</i> (2001), and <i>America&#x2019;s Response to China: A History of Sino-American Relations</i> (fifth edition, 2010).A lively, well-written history of America&#x2019;s foreign policy and diplomacy from 1776 to the present. This is a superb synthesis, in places quite provocative in its arguments, and a signal accomplishment. (George Herring, University of Kentucky)<br><br><i>A Nation Like All Others</i> is a book like none other. Warren I. Cohen offers an authoritative but brief overview of American interactions with the wider world from the founding of the nation to our present day. He covers all the major events with acute observations about the sources of policy, compelling judgments of decision makers, and thoughtful ruminations about how things fit together (or not). This is an opinionated survey of American trials and tribulations, delivered as a single narrative with larger-than-life protagonists. (Jeremi Suri, University of Texas at Austin)<br><br>In this brief and illuminating account of U.S. foreign policy from Benjamin Franklin and the American Revolution to Donald Trump and &#x2018;America first,&#x2019; Cohen displays the wisdom and insight that have made him one of the country&#x2019;s most admired chroniclers of American diplomacy. Lamenting the nation&#x2019;s loss of its moral compass, Cohen deftly probes the economic, strategic, and domestic political imperatives that make it so difficult to reconcile the exceptionalism he cherishes with the realism he admires. (Melvyn P. Leffler, Edward Stettinius Professor of American History, University of Virginia)<br><br>Cohen&#x2019;s lucid writing and distinguished scholarship have settled key questions in the history of U.S.-Asian relations, and he does the same here in magnificently relating four hundred years of U.S. relations with the world. Gemlike portrayals of Ben Franklin through McKinley (the 1890s marked &#x2018;the point of no return&#x2019; for Americans) to Obama will attract students and general readers alike. (Walter LaFeber, Cornell University)<br><br>Cohen&#x2019;s deep scholarship and incisive writing have combined to make him for decades the leading historian of American foreign policy and diplomacy.

"Worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood." Welcome, then, to the pinnacle of the miserable Irish Catholic childhood. Born in Brooklyn in 1930 to recent Irish immigrants Malachy and Angela McCourt, Frank grew up in Limerick after his parents returned to Ireland because of poor prospects in America. It turns out that prospects weren't so great back in the old country either--not with Malachy for a father. A chronically unemployed and nearly unemployable alcoholic, he appears to be the model on which many of our more insulting cliches about drunken Irish manhood are based. Mix in abject poverty and frequent death and illness and you have all the makings of a truly difficult early life. Fortunately, in McCourt's able hands it also has all the makings for a compelling memoir.<blockquote><i> "When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."</i></blockquote> <p> So begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy -- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. </p><p> Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. </p><p> <i>Angela's Ashes</i>, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.</p></p><h2>Hermann Hesse: Life and Art</h2><p>"A critical biography far surpassing the previous ones."--<i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>&nbsp;"There are to be sure many writers whose biographies are more interesting than their fiction but Hesse is not one of these. He led a long and sometimes eventful life with marital tensions, traveL controversy, crises, even some thoughts of suicide and a period of time as a student in a home for retarded and unmanageable. In addition, there was his search which led him through the culture and arts of West and East, his views of politics and society, of psychology and philosophy. The difference between Hesse and other writers is that virtually every shred and patch of his life was brought into his writing, his fiction particularly. 'He had to write about himself and there is little of what he wrote that is not confessional in form and therapeutic in function.' Autobiography is the very matter of his work. Mileck's contribution is to extend and fill out the evidence of his life, his psychoanalysis, his drive toward self-realization which was the very engine of his being, to show the raw material and thus to invite readers to see how it was transmuted, transfigured, fantasized, poeticized, symbolized."--<i>Los Angeles Times</i>&nbsp;"Hesse was a prolific author for some 60 years, and his mind drew everything it contemplated into his private wars between flesh and spirit. objectivity and subjectivity, the longings for society and isolation. No one is better qualified to disentangle this abundance than Mileck, compiler of the huge two-volume Hesse bibliography. For completeness, then, no biography in English compares."&nbsp;--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>&nbsp;"Mileck provides his own translations of the German quotations from Hesse's works, and the eight interpretive chapters are thoroughly indexed, making the work readily accessible to researchers and students concerned with specific Hesse questions and themes. This very readable book also contains a number of exceptional photographs, which, together with Mileck's fervor and understanding of the author, help create a living image of Hesse the man and the artist."--<i>Choice</i>&nbsp;"Professor Mileck . .. brings to his task an acquaintanceship with Hesse's published and unpublished writings .. . which borders on omniscience. This is a literary biography which concentrates on the works and looks at the life of its subject briefly and always in relation to its involvement with the works . . .

How do we determine that a doctor who has sex with his patients is exploiting them? In this book, Alan Wertheimer seeks to identify when a transaction or relationship can be properly regarded as exploitative--and not oppressive, manipulative, or morally deficient in some other way--and explores the moral weight of taking unfair advantage. Among the first political philosophers to examine this important topic from a non-Marxist perspective, Wertheimer writes about ordinary experience in an accessible yet philosophically penetrating way. He considers whether it is seriously wrong for a party to exploit another if the transaction is consensual and mutually advantageous, whether society can justifiably prohibit people from entering into such a transaction, and whether it is wrong to allow oneself to be exploited.</p><br><p> Wertheimer first considers several contexts commonly characterized as exploitive, including surrogate motherhood, unconscionable contracts, the exploitation of student athletes, and sexual exploitation in psychotherapy. In a section outlining his theory of exploitation, he sets forth the criteria for a fair transaction and the point at which we can properly say that a party has consented. Whereas many discussions of exploitation have dealt primarily with cases in which one party harms or coerces another, Wertheimer's book focuses on what makes a mutually advantageous and consensual transaction exploitive and analyzes the moral and legal implications of such exploitation.</p></p><p><b>Alan Wertheimer</b> is John G.

Its more than 6,000 alphabetical entries provide an incomparable range of useful and little-known source material, its scholarship enlivened by the author&#39;s wit and candor.</p><p><strong>John Sutherland </strong>is the author of many books, including <em>Lives of the Novelists</em> and <em>How to Be Well Read</em>. He is the Lord Northcliffe Professor of English emeritus at University College London.The canon of Victorian fiction represents only a minuscule fraction of the thousands of titles available to read. Here, in language often reflecting Victorian modes of expression, Sutherland makes this fraction more accessible through a dictionary arrangement of 1606 author and title entries. Authors and titles naturally predominate, but publishers, periodicals, illustrators, and sub-genres are treated as well. Compulsively browsable, this companion offers new discoveries on each page, even to those immersed in the field. Its solo authorship accounts for its blemishes as well as its charms. Some entries for items well known to this reviewer have small inaccuracies, possibly due to reliance on conventional biographical sources (for instance, the Dictionary of National Biography ).

But as Elizabeth Varon reveals in this vividly narrated history, this rosy image conceals a seething debate over precisely what the surrender meant and what kind of nation would emerge from war. The combatants in that debate included the iconic Lee and Grant, but they also included a cast of characters previously overlooked, who brought their own understanding of the war's causes, consequences, and meaning. <br><br>In <em>Appomattox</em>, Varon deftly captures the events swirling around that well remembered-but not well understood-moment when the Civil War ended. She expertly depicts the final battles in Virginia, when Grant's troops surrounded Lee's half-starved army, the meeting of the generals at the McLean House, and the shocked reaction as news of the surrender spread like an electric charge throughout the nation. But as Varon shows, the ink had hardly dried before both sides launched a bitter debate over the meaning of the war and the nation's future. For Grant, and for most in the North, the Union victory was one of right over wrong, a vindication of free society; for many African Americans, the surrender marked the dawn of freedom itself. Lee, in contrast, believed that the Union victory was one of might over right: the vast impersonal Northern war machine had worn down a valorous and unbowed South. Lee was committed to peace, but committed, too, to the restoration of the South's political power within the Union and the perpetuation of white supremacy. These two competing visions of the war's end paved the way not only for Southern resistance to reconstruction but also our ongoing debates on the Civil War, 150 years later. <br><br>Did America's best days lie in the past or in the future? For Lee, it was the past, the era of the founding generation. For Grant, it was the future, represented by Northern moral and material progress. They held, in the end, two opposite views of the direction of the country-and of the meaning of the war that had changed that country forever.<br></p><p><br><strong>Elizabeth R.

[Varon] successfully resurrects the true April 1865 event as one fraught with anxiety, passion, and, above all, political conflict." --<em>North Carolina Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"[A] compelling new account of the war's end... Rather than emphasizing the finality of military defeat, Varon stresses the uncertainty of the subsequent days, weeks, and months." --Sarah Bowman, <em>Civil War Monitor</em><p></p><br>"A very fine account... In the end, as Varon so ably demonstrates, Appomattox did not end a war. It just closed the phase of that contest characterized by armed conflict. The much older war would go on. In some ways, it is not over yet." --William C. Davis, History Book Club<p></p><br>"Excellent and thought-provoking...Varon...treats Appomattox as a major event in American history, worth extensive analysis, but also as a very engaging human story." --James E. Sefton, <em>Civil War Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Elizabeth Varon successfully argues in her groundbreaking book that the seeds for the post-Civil War world started before the ink had dried on the surrender agreement signed by Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House... A careful construction and analysis of the meaning of Appomattox to many different people." --James Percoco, <em>Civil War News</em><p></p><br>"A careful, scholarly consideration of how the ambiguities surrounding the defeat of the South resolved into the bitter eras of Reconstruction and Jim Crow." --<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"In this powerful analysis of the substantive and symbolic meanings of the surrender at Appomattox, Elizabeth Varon shows how that iconic moment has shaped a range of perceptions of the Civil War and its consequences. Grant and Lee emerge with new richness and complexity in this important book, one of the best to appear during these years of the war's sesquicentennial anniversaries." --James McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em><p></p><br>"In lively prose, Elizabeth Varon demonstrates that much of what we think we know about Lee's surrender to Grant in April 1865 is misleading, embellished, or just plain wrong, but even more important, she portrays the ending of the Civil War less as a moment of innocence than as long process, begun before the ink on the surrender signatures had dried, in which white and black Americans of all regions and varying political stripes shrewdly contested the meaning of the war." --Chandra Manning, author of <em>What This Cruel War Was Over</em><p></p><br>"In a short space, Elizabeth Varon has not only given us a graceful narrative of the epochal surrender at Appomattox, but has also awakened us to the bitterly-contested meanings of that surrender. The war that ended at Appomattox did not subside into a happy story of fraternal reconciliation, but into an ongoing struggle between those who believed the war had brought a new age of freedom and equality into existence, and those who fought to keep the South's feudal past upon its throne. We will not be able to look at Appomattox, or the legacy of the Civil War, in simplistic terms again." --Allen C. Guelzo, author of <em>Gettysburg: The Last Invasion</em><p></p><br>"Elizabeth Varon's elegant meditation on the complex legacy of the Appomattox surrender combines finely grained social history with penetrating analysis of one of the great mythic moments in American history. Closing out the Civil War, Lee and Grant's fateful meeting ushered in a harmonious reunion of a country destined for greatness. Or did it? Varon's meticulous unpacking of the layers of falsehood surrounding the myth lays bare a painful truth-that there was no unified vision of what peace might bring to a troubled and still bitterly divided nation." --Joan Waugh, University of California, Los Angeles<p></p><br>"Based on exceptionally thorough research, Elizabeth Varon's study meticulously dissects the sentimental, romantic version of the Appomattox story, which portrays it as an apolitical, magnanimous event. Varon shows convincingly that Robert E. Lee and other Confederates made the Army of Northern Virginia's surrender the opening shot in the battle over Reconstruction, and that the seeds of Reconstruction's failure were sown at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865." --Michael Burlingame, author of <em>Abraham Lincoln: A Life</em><p></p><br>"Varon probes deep into the psyches of Lee and Grant and analyzes them with fresh eyes to understand what kind of nation they envisioned emerging from the wreckage of war... Varon also delves into the letters, diaries, and memoirs left by the men of the two armies who fought each other during those last desperate days... In her clear, confident, yet elegant, prose, Varon gives renewed life to many of the players in the last act of America's greatest tragedy." --Gordon Berg, Civil War Round Table of the District of Columbia<p></p><br>"We are always looking for books that enable us to see the Lees in a new way. Elizabeth Varon's new book, <em>Appomattox: Victory, Defeat, and Freedom at the End of the Civil War</em> does just that... A compelling tale." --Paul Reber, Executive Director, Stratford Hall<p></p><br>"Varon is effective in dispelling the various myths that have sprung up over the surrender itself, including the fabled meeting under an apple tree, which never happened. Using a wealth of primary and secondary sources, the work is excellent in never treating either North or South as monolithic. The author thoroughly discusses the roles of African Americans in both sections, and gives the political opponents in both regions their say." --K.L. Gorman, Minnesota State University, Mankato, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Elizabeth Varon's elegant narrative, provocative argument, and skillful use of sources make this work an interesting addition to the historiography of the Civil War Era." --<em>Southern Literary Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"A compelling account of the courses taken by Grant and Lee and a superb look at how the public in both sections endeavored to understand what had happened-and what it portended for the future." --Ethan S. Rafuse, <em>America's Civil War</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Max Beerbohm Caricatures</h2><p>This delightful book is an anthology of Beerbohm`s best images, accompanied by historical and analytical commentary by N. John Hall that is enriched by liberal quotation from Beerbohm`s own witty essays, criticism, letters, and fiction.</p><p>"The incomparable Max" was indeed incomparable--a writer of wit, charm, and originality, and a caricaturist with an "unfailing eye for the centre of a situation" and a "gift for fixing it in a memorably comic form." The collection of drawings presented by Mr. Hall covers Beerbohm's field of victims thoroughly. Authors, artists, actors, politicians, and royalty were all his targets. The text and notes are well written (exceptionally so for the art-book genre) and reinforced by quotations from Max and his highly articulate contemporaries. Max gave up cartooning by 1942, because, he explained, "I began to remember people more or less exactly as they were, and was obliged to put in the exaggerations consciously." An earlier description of his methods emphasized memory, not direct vision, as the basis of his resolutely unrealistic art. "I cannot," he wrote a friend, "imagine a worse thing befalling anyone than to see the streets peopled with my creations. It has never befallen me." The late drawings from the years shortly before Max "laid aside" his pencil show clearly what had happened. The subjects are recognizable, but they are no longer victims. The gadfly had lost his sting, and Max, a sound critic, knew it. But in his heyday he gave wonderfully effective and amusing jabs that can still draw a chuckle. -- <i>The Atlantic Monthly, Phoebe-Lou Adams</i><br><br>Hall's witty commentary is supplemented by Beerbohm's own prose as well as contemporary observations by the likes of Virginia Woolf and E. F. Benson.... More entertaining than conventional histories of the period, Hall's collection animates an era of eccentrics, many of whose priceless peculiarities would, but for Beerbohm, have been erased by time. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, Sarah Harrison Smith</i></p><h2>Winning the Loser&#39;s Game, 6th edition: Timeless Strategies for Successful Investing</h2><p><p><b>The classic guide to winning on Wall Street--completely updated and expanded!</b></p> <p>The go-to guide for anyone seeking long-term gain in the stock market, <i>Winning the Loser's Game</i> was referred to by the great Peter Drucker as "by far the best book on investment policy and management."</p> <p>Dr. Charles Ellis, dubbed "Wall Street's Wisest Man" by <i>Money</i> magazine, has been showing investors for three decades how stock markets really work and what individuals can do to be sure they are long-term winners.

Being a rabbi means serving as a Symbolic Exemplar of the best that is in humankind, being experienced and treated and expected to act as a stand-in for God, and a walking, talking symbol of all that Jewish tradition represents. The burden of being a symbolic exemplar of God is extraordinary, and the struggle to live up to its requirements can be one of loneliness, frustration, and despair, alienating rabbis who tire of living in a glass house.<br><br>The Rabbi As Symbolic Exemplar examines how the symbolic role that serves as the source of the rabbi&#x2019;s authority and power can lead to disillusionment and disenchantment. Author Jack H Bloom draws on his own experience as a rabbi who watched the successful career he enjoyed turn into one he desperately wanted to forsake and how he was inspired to become an athletic coach for rabbis. This unique book details how symbolic exemplarhood is created, what its downside is, what power it offers, how it can be used effectively, how rabbis can deal with their inner lives, and what can be done to help rabbis stay human while maintaining their leadership.<br><br>The Rabbi As Symbolic Exemplar is equally effective as a complete text or as a source of stand-alone chapters on specific topics, including:<br><ul><li> special tensions of being a rabbi<br></li><li> effects of symbolic exemplarhood on the rabbi&#x2019;s family<br></li><li> educating rabbis on their power<br></li><li> training suggestions<br></li><li> curing and healing<br></li><li> and The Ten Commandments for rabbis<br><br></li></ul>The Rabbi As Symbolic Exemplar is essential reading for rabbis, rabbinical students, congregants, Christian clergy, seminarians and anyone interested in what it is to be a clergy person and how they can support the work clergy do.

Jorge Luis Borges called him &#x201c;a soul above.&#x201d; Graves wrote almost restlessly on subjects of great diversity: myths of the Greeks, Romans, Hebrews, and Celts; modern science and economics; contemporary society and culture as well as of ancient Greece and Rome, of Celtic Wales and Ireland, of the time of Milton, and of the American Revolution.</p><p> He was a poet of great fame, a celebrated writer of historical novels, and the man who imprinted the name and identity of the White Goddess upon the cultural language. His translations of Latin classics have been applauded; his recastings of Biblical and Persian texts attracted irascible attention from scholars.</p><p> Throughout his long and productive life, whether he was talking with Virginia Woolf, Peter Quenell, Jorge Luis Borges, Alan Sillitoe, Edwin Newman, or Gina Lollobrigida, the voice of Graves remained clear and distinct&#x2015;attracting and repelling a variety of interviewers with its surety.

While many studies have been done since then, few of them invalidate the general conclusions and recommendations Allen offers. In a new preface he points out - new developments, noting areas that need some modification, elaboration, or extension, and directing readers to the appropriate journal articles where the findings, are reported.</p><p>The first three chapters provide an overview of the communication system in technology, present the author's research methods, and describe differences in the career paths and goals of engineers and scientists that cause special problems for organizations. The book then discusses how technological information is acquired by the R &amp; D organization, shows how critical technical communication within the laboratory is for R &amp; D performance, and originates the idea of the "gatekeeper," the person who links his or her organization to the world at large.</p><p>Concluding chapters take up the influence of formal and informal organization and of architecture and office layouts on communication. Many of these ideas have been successfully incorporated by architects and managers in the design of new R &amp; D facilities and complexes.</p></p><p>Thomas J.

The entries are presented in order of opus number, with unnumbered compositions inserted appropriately within this chronological sequence.<br><br>The catalogue is supplemented by a series of appendices, which includes a chronological chart of the composer's life and work and a discussion of the monogram DSCH, a musical motif based on his name that permeates his compositions.</p><p><b>Derek Hulme</b> is a jet engine designer and part-time dance band trumpeter.

Drawn from the holdings of the Museum of Fine Arts in Leipzig, Houston's sister city, the 84 examples given here are presented chronologically. The artists most represented are Max Klinger, Adrian Ludwig Richter, Philipp Otto Runge, and Caspar David Friedrich. An introductory essay called "Diversity Within Unity?" by Helmut B rsch-Supan (Caspar David Friedrich) explains the importance of regional centers such as Dusseldorf, Munich, Berlin, and Dresden and the critical roles of Rome and Paris as study destinations. B rsch-Supan joins with five other specialists to analyze the artworks and to discuss influences such as the Italian and German Renaissance on the Nazarenes, the Gothic period on the Romantics, and Dutch genre and landscape painting, Neoclassicism, Academic art, French Realism, Impressionism, and Symbolism on the evolving German styles.

As the intelligence community and cold war analysts churned out statistics demonstrating the enduring strength of the Moscow regime, Moynihan, focusing on ethnic conflict, argued that the end was at hand. Now, with such conflict breaking out across the world, from Central Asia to South Central Los Angeles, he sets forth a general proposition: Far from vanishing, ethnicity has been and will be an elemental force in international politics.<br> Drawing on a lifetime of scholarship, the Senator provides in <em>Pandaemonium</em> a subtle, richly textured account of the process by which theory has grudgingly begun to adapt to reality. Moynihan--whose previous studies range over thirty years from <em>Beyond the Melting Pot</em> (with Nathan Glazer) to the much acclaimed <em>On the Law of Nations</em>--provides a deep historical look at ethnic conflict around the globe. He shows how the struggles that now absorb our attention have been going on for generations and explain much of modern history. Neither side in the cold war grasped this reality, he writes. Neither the liberal myth of the melting pot nor the Marxist fantasy of proletarian internationalism could account for ethnic conflict, and so the international system stumbled from one set of miscalculations to another.<br> Toward the close of World War I, Woodrow Wilson declared the "self-determination of peoples" to be an Allied goal for the peace. Toward the end of World War II, Josef Stalin inserted "self-determination of peoples" into Article I of the United Nations Charter, defining "The Purposes" of the new world organization. This process has been going on ever since. The first phase, the breaking up of empire, was relatively peaceful. The second phase, presaged by the 1947 partition of India, is certain to be far more troubled, as fifty to a hundred new countries emerge.<br> Moynihan argues, however, that a dark age of "ethnic cleansing" is not inevitable; that the dynamics of ethnic conflict can be understood, anticipated, moderated. Ethnic pride can be a source of dignity and of stability, if only its legitimacy is accepted. Moynihan writes in a learned, reflective voice: at times theoretical, but always in the end directed to issues of fierce immediacy. A splendid achievement, <em>Pandaemonium</em> begins the re-education of Western diplomacy.<br></p><p><br><strong>Daniel Patrick Moynihan</strong> is the senior Senator from New York. A former professor of government at Harvard University, he has served as Ambassador to India and to the United Nations, where he represented the United States as President of the Security Council.<br>A timely, informed plea from New York's senior US senator ``to make the world safe for and from ethnicity.'' Moynihan presented an early version of this material in November 1991 as a lecture at Oxford; he's updated that text with notes on such events as the ``ethnic cleansing'' occurring in Bosnia. There's a certain amount of self-congratulation here (guess which politician, virtually alone in the 80's, predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union while the ``realists'' wailed about the Red tide?), but, at his best, Moynihan displays erudition and a mastery of material. Both the American liberal belief in a melting pot and the Marxist belief in class solidarity, he shows, badly underestimated ``the persistence of ethnicity.'' Although a believer in Woodrow Wilson's notion of international law, he points out what a Pandora's box that visionary's concept of ``self- determination'' has proven. Not only did Wilson refuse to apply the concept to America's allies (notably regarding Britain's control of Ireland), but he was ignorant of the idea's presumed beneficiaries and fuzzy about what the term meant in the first place. Moynihan lucidly explains how Communists pushed self-determination for ethnic groups without reconciling this with an international proletarian movement; how the UN Charter has been bedeviled by contradictory clauses on self-determination and noninterference with nations' internal affairs; and how preferential policies for majorities and entrenched minorities, both abroad and at home, exacerbate intergroup conflict. Throughout, the senator's mordant observations on historical myopia are leavened with typically puckish wit (``For years Europeans asked: Why is there no Socialist movement in the United States? The answer may be that we knew better''). The latest in a series (On the Law of Nations, 1990, etc.) demonstrating that Moynihan may be America's foremost literary politician--someone who can advance policy as cogently on the written page as on the stump. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The plan nearly succeeded, and almost certainly would have, were it not for one small Belgian town and its tenacious American defenders who held back a tenfold larger German force while awaiting the arrival of General George Patton&#x2019;s mighty Third Army.<br><br> In this dramatic account of the 1944&#x2013;45 winter of war in Bastogne, historian Peter Schrijvers offers the first full story of the German assault on the strategically located town. From the December stampede of American and Panzer divisions racing to reach Bastogne first, through the bloody eight-day siege from land and air, and through three more weeks of unrelenting fighting even after the siege was broken, events at Bastogne hastened the long-awaited end of WWII. Schrijvers draws on diaries, memoirs, and other fresh sources to illuminate the experiences not only of Bastogne&#x2019;s 3,000 citizens and their American defenders, but also of German soldiers and commanders desperate for victory. The costs of war are here made real, uncovered in the stories of those who perished and those who emerged from battle to find the world forever changed.</p><p><b>Peter Schrijvers,</b> a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, is the author of five previous books on World War II."A fast-paced story. . . .

The latest science reveals how we can do it right.</b><br>In 2011, when an international survey reported that students in Shanghai dramatically outperformed American students in reading, math, and science, President Obama declared it a "Sputnik moment": a wake-up call about the dismal state of American education. Little has changed, however, since then: over half of our children still read at a basic level and few become highly proficient. Many American children and adults are not functionally literate, with serious consequences. Poor readers are more likely to drop out of the educational system and as adults are unable to fully participate in the workforce, adequately manage their own health care, or advance their children's education.<br><br>In <i>Language at the Speed of Sight</i>, internationally renowned cognitive scientist Mark Seidenberg reveals the underexplored science of reading, which spans cognitive science, neurobiology, and linguistics. As Seidenberg shows, the disconnect between science and education is a major factor in America's chronic underachievement. How we teach reading places many children at risk of failure, discriminates against poorer kids, and discourages even those who could have become more successful readers. Children aren't taught basic print skills because educators cling to the disproved theory that good readers guess the words in texts, a strategy that encourages skimming instead of close reading. Interventions for children with reading disabilities are delayed because parents are mistakenly told their kids will catch up if they work harder. Learning to read is more difficult for children who speak a minority dialect in the home, but that is not reflected in classroom practices. By building on science's insights, we can improve how our children read, and take real steps toward solving the inequality that illiteracy breeds.<br><br>Both an expert look at our relationship with the written word and a rousing call to action, <i>Language at the Speed of Sight </i>is essential for parents, educators, policy makers, and all others who want to understand why so many fail to read, and how to change that. <br></p><p><br><b>ADVANCE PRAISE FOR <i>LANGUAGE AT THE SPEED OF SIGHT</i>:</b><br><br>?No technologically advanced society exists without reading.

In this volume, a respected biblical scholar and teacher explores how cultural anthropology and ritual studies elucidate ancient texts. Charles Bobertz offers a liturgical reading of the Gospel of Mark, arguing that the Gospel is a narrative interpretation of early Christian ritual. This fresh, responsible, and creative proposal will benefit scholars, professors, and students. Its ecclesial and pastoral ramifications will also be of interest to church leaders and pastors.</p><p>"All reconstructions of the Markan community are conjectural. Presented as a commentary on the Second Gospel, Professor Bobertz's proposal adopts a liturgical attitude toward diverse social pressures exerted upon Christian readers in the apostolic age. His argument is closely reasoned, well researched, jargon-free, clear, and resolute. Those appreciative of Mark's literary artistry will find in Bobertz's interpretation a stimulus for the continued study of 'a story of deep symbolism and ritual complexity.'"<br>--<b>C. Clifton Black</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"Bobertz takes the bold but necessary step of restoring Mark's Gospel to its original context--not just to the first century or to some ancient Christian author or literary genre, but to the earliest Christian communities and gatherings, formed in the ritual crucible of baptism and Eucharist. This is not merely a 'liturgical' reading in any narrow sense, but a genuinely contextual one, which not only bears new insights into the ancient origin and setting of the Gospel, but offers modern readers fresh insight into its relevance for them as members of baptized and eucharistic communities."<br>--<b>Andrew McGowan</b>, Yale Divinity School<br><br>"In an exhilarating journey through Mark's Gospel, Bobertz shows how the evangelist drew continually upon the language and practices of baptism and Eucharist. Mark's overarching purpose in doing so, Bobertz contends, was to resolve discord over Gentiles' presence at the Lord's Table by showing that through Jesus's life, passion, and resurrection (in which Christians participate through the liturgy) God created a profoundly inclusive church. Bobertz's demonstration that Mark's Jesus--and his followers!--move through ordinary time yet also transcend it will fire imaginations and raise appreciation for Mark's gifts as narrator and for the power of Christian liturgy."<br>--<b>Susan R. Garrett</b>, Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary<br><br>"Why hasn't anyone done this before?&nbsp;If we know that Mark and our other narrative Gospels were performed in ritualized settings, especially the Christian communal meal, then why not read them as though they meant something specific in those settings?&nbsp;Bobertz's reading of the Gospel of Mark is an interpretive and methodological breakthrough.&nbsp;With this book a new discussion of the Gospels begins: When early Christians gathered to eat the Lord's Supper or to baptize newcomers, how did these narratives set the mood and answer the questions, Who are we? and Why are we together like this?"<br>--<b>Stephen J.

Today she is best known as the innovative &#x201c;mother&#x201d; of the French New Wave film movement of the 1950s and '60s and for her multimedia art exhibitions. Varying her use of different media, she is a figure who defies easy categorization. In this extensively researched book, Rebecca J. DeRoo demonstrates how Varda draws upon the histories of art, photography, and film to complicate the overt narratives in her works and to advance contemporary cultural politics. Based on interviews with Varda and unparalleled access to Varda's archives, this interdisciplinary study constructs new frameworks for understanding one of the most versatile talents in twentieth and twenty-first century culture.</p><p>"Rebecca DeRoo&#x2019;s latest publication,&nbsp;<i>Agn�s Varda between Film, Photography, and&nbsp;Art,&nbsp;</i>offers her readers a dazzling study of the filmmaker's cinematographic art. Not only does DeRoo propose a refreshingly new dialogic approach to Varda&#x2019;s cinematic aesthetics, narrative practice, and sociopolitics, her analyses of individual films are full of insights that also, where appropriate, challenge established readings of Varda&#x2019;s work. This is truly a gem of a book."&#x2014;Susan Hayward, Professor of Cinema Studies Emerita, University of Exeter<br><br> &#x201c;With extraordinary access to Agn�s Varda&#x2019;s papers and production materials, Rebecca DeRoo&#x2019;s study uniquely illuminates what Varda called the 'three lives of Agn�s'&#x2014;as photographer, filmmaker, and visual artist. The author insightfully tracks Varda&#x2019;s generative semantic slippages across different media and also provides a smart reevaluation of the filmmaker&#x2019;s restless inventiveness. Essentially reframing Varda&#x2019;s anomalous place in film history, DeRoo&#x2019;s refined analysis and detailed references to film, art, and photography history help reveal Varda&#x2019;s multivalent work, showing the constant purpose and experimentation animating her audiovisual, tactile, and memorial sensibility.&#x201d; &#x2014;Ivone Margulies, Professor of Film and Media Studies, Hunter College, CUNY<br><br> &#x201c;In this pathbreaking revisionist study, art and cinema historian Rebecca DeRoo uses multiple political and cultural contexts to reframe the existing dialogue about the work and contributions to cinema history made by the New Wave French film director Agn�s Varda. Stressing issues that are aesthetic, theoretical, feminist, and political, DeRoo redirects the biographical narratives that have been favored in the literature on Varda, challenges conventional interpretations of Varda's films, and recasts the reception of Varda&#x2019;s work over the space of six decades as an index to the cultural and political assumptions of those years. In an era when the boundaries between cinema and other art forms have become increasingly blurred, DeRoo&#x2019;s approach to Varda&#x2019;s work is a productive and exemplary intersection between cinema studies and art history.&#x201d; &#x2014;Norma Broude, Professor of Art History Emerita, American University<b>Rebecca J.

The last of Cooper&#x2019;s famous Leatherstocking Tales, it is first chronologically in the frontier adventures of the backwoods scout Natty Bumppo. Amid a terrain largely inspired by Cooper&#x2019;s own boyhood, Natty&#x2019;s initiation in the moral codes of wilderness society is examined in what is, according to D. H. Lawrence, &#x201c;the loveliest and best&#x201d; of the Leatherstocking series.<br><br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the definitive text established by James Franklin Beard and James P. Elliott, which is the Approved Text of the Center for Scholarly Editions of the Modern Language Association.</p><p>The deadly crack of a long rifle and the piercing cries of Indians on the warpath shatter the serenity of beautiful lake Glimmerglass. Danger has invaded the vast forests of upper New York State as Deerslayer and his loyal Mohican friend Chingachgook attempt the daring rescue of an Indian maiden imprisoned in a Huron camp. Soon they are caught in the crossfire between a cunning enemy and two white bounty hunters who mercilessly kill for profit. The last of the Leatherstocking tales to be written, though first in the chronology of the hero's life, <i>The Deerslayer</i> is James Fenimore Cooper's masterpiece. A fine combination of romance, adventure, and morality; this classic novel of the frontier is an eloquent beginning for Cooper's great wilderness saga--and an unforgettable introduction to the famous character who has said to embody the conscience of America: the noble woodsman Deerslayer.&#x201c;James Fenimore Cooper was the first great American novelist.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>A. B. Guthrie</b></p><h2>Marked in Your Flesh: Circumcision from Ancient Judea to Modern America</h2><p>The book of Genesis tells us that God made a covenant with Abraham, promising him a glorious posterity on the condition that he and all his male descendents must be circumcised. For thousands of years thereafter, the distinctive practice of circumcision served to set the Jews apart from their neighbors. The apostle Paul rejected it as a worthless practice, emblematic of Judaism's fixation on physical matters. Christian theologians followed his lead, arguing that whereas Christians sought spiritual fulfillment, Jews remained mired in such pointless concerns as diet and circumcision. As time went on, Europeans developed folklore about malicious Jews who performed sacrificial murders of Christian children and delighted in genital mutilation. But Jews held unwaveringly to the belief that being a Jewish male meant being physically circumcised and to this day even most non-observant Jews continue to follow this practice. In this book, Leonard B. Glick offers a history of Jewish and Christian beliefs about circumcision from its ancient origins to the current controversy. By the turn of the century, more and more physicians in America and England--but not, interestingly, in continental Europe--were performing the procedure routinely. Glick shows that Jewish American physicians were and continue to be especially vocal and influential champions of the practice which, he notes, serves to erase the visible difference between Jewish and gentile males. Informed medical opinion is now unanimous that circumcision confers no benefit and the practice has declined. In Jewish circles it is virtually taboo to question circumcision, but Glick does not flinch from asking whether this procedure should continue to be the defining feature of modern Jewish identity.<br></p><p><br><strong>Leonard B. Glick</strong> is a cultural anthropologist with a medical degree and a doctorate in anthropology. He is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Hampshire College and is the author of <em>Abraham's Heirs: Jews and Christians in Medieval Europe</em> (1999).<br><br>"Baby girls in the United States are spared such treatment, and laws are now in place to protect them. Glick provides readers with a wealth of information to question how this different treatment of patients based on gender can be acceptable, and he asks them to agree with him that it is not."--<em>The</em> <em>Historian</em><p></p><br>"<em>Marked in Your Flesh</em> is an ambitious study of the ancient rite of circumcision, which has been central to the demarcation of Jewish identity from biblical times to the present. There have been many studies of circumcision, but Leonard Glicks is distinguished both by its impressive historical range and its sophisticated commingling of anthropological and textual methodologies. Through painstaking analysis the author has unmasked many of the socio-cultural and religious underpinnings of circumcision. <em>Marked in Your Flesh</em> should appeal to anyone interested in this practice."--Elliot R. Wolfson, Abraham Lieberman Professor of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, New York University<p></p><br>"<em>Marked in Your Flesh</em> shines as the rarest of beasts-a book that is learned yet accessible, deeply serious yet profoundly entertaining. Glick writes with one eye carefully checking footnotes while the other eye compassionately keeps watch over the precious newborn babies that are his ultimate subject. This engagingly written book contains lessons applicable to all of us concerned with protecting human rights and human well-being against encroachment by cultural and social forces."--J.

How can a virology student possibly make sense of all this information? In How Pathogenic Viruses Think, Second Edition, Dr. Sompayrac introduces an "organizing principle" - a paradigm to use to cut through all the details and focus on what's important. He demonstrates the use of this paradigm by "interviewing" twelve medically important viruses. During these interviews, each virus is encouraged to disclose not only what it does, but why it does it. And when a "talking virus" reveals its secrets, they are hard to forget!<br><br>How Pathogenic Viruses Think covers the essential elements of virus-host interactions with descriptive graphics, helpful mnemonic tactics for retaining the information, and brief reviews of important concepts. It is an ideal book to help medical, science, and nursing students make sense of this complex subject. <br><br>Example:<br><br>Interviewer: I always ask the viruses I interview, "How do you attack your hosts, and why have you chosen that route?"<br><br>Flu Virus: I favor the respiratory route.<br><br>Interviewer: Okay, but why? For example, why not enter via the digestive tract?<br><br>Flu Virus: Are you kidding me? Do I look like a dumb virus to you? My Uncle Harold tried the digestive tract once, and got as far as the stomach before the acid in there ate him alive! Not me. I take the easy way in. The respiratory route of infection provides direct access to my favorite target cells - the epithelial cells which line the human airway.</p><p>Retired Professor, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado</p><h2>Celts and the Classical World</h2><p>To observe the Celts through the eyes of the Greeks and Romans is the first aim of this book.</p><p>David Rankin is Professor of Philosophy and Classics at the University of Southhampton...."takes a valuable place beside the major compilations on the Celts published recently."<br>-The Journal of Indo-European Studies <br>"Professor Rankin's book does provide a thoroughly researched and clearly presented picture of those Celts who strayed into the classical world and of the fringe Celtic communities at the moment when they were overrun and assimilated by Rome.

They read passionately, far above their grade level; tackle algebra; and stage Shakespeare so professionally that they often wow the great Shakespearen actor himself, Sir Ian McKellen. Yet Esquith teaches at an L.A. innercity school known as the Jungle, where few of his students speak English at home, and many are from poor or troubled families. What&#x2019;s his winning recipe? A diet of intensive learning mixed with a lot of kindness and fun. His kids attend class from 6:30 A.M. until well after 4:00 P.M., right through most of their vacations. They take field trips to Europe and Yosemite. They play rock and roll. Mediocrity has no place in their classroom. And the results follow them for life, as they go on to colleges such as Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford. <br>Possessed by a fierce idealism, Esquith works even harder than his students. As an outspoken maverick of public education (his heroes include Huck Finn and Atticus Finch), he admits to significant mistakes and heated fights with administrators and colleagues. We all&#x2014;teachers, parents, citizens&#x2014;have much to learn from his candor and uncompromising vision.</p><p><b>Rafe Esquithis</b> an award-winning&nbsp;American&nbsp;teacher who taught at&nbsp;Hobart Boulevard Elementary School, in&nbsp;Los Angeles,&nbsp;California, from 1984 until 2015.

He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Barbara Tong.Chapter 1<br><br><b>Curtains</b><br><br>It's dangerous to think too much about public education. So many things are wrong with it that it's easier simply to go on a search-and-destroy mission and write only about the horror of it all. Those of us who have survived school have plenty of scars. Any person who has taught for more than a few years has met administrators, teachers, parents, and children who, as Mark Twain once remarked, "make a body ashamed of the human race."<br><br>That's not my mission here. More than anything else, this book is meant to be a reminder of what public education can be. But to understand where we might consider going, it becomes painfully necessary to examine some things that we usually try to avoid.<br><br>I have one more objective, too: I want to give hope to young teachers who would like to run against the wind but are afraid of the consequences. I am living proof that you can have success as a teacher despite the many forces that are working against you. Like the Founding Fathers, I am a lover of independence, and freethinkers are not fash- ionable in public schools today. Instead, as public schools fail, bureaucrats are attempting to solve serious problems with simplistic solutions. They're afraid to examine the real reasons why our schools are failing, so they use fashion- able words or pretty new textbooks to try and solve the very real problems that are destroying our classrooms. Poverty, greed, and incompetent teaching are just some of the reasons why Johnny not only can't read but has no interest in reading. Using a new reading series or changing the classroom environment isn't going to solve our problems. Most tragic of all, many districts are trying to take charge of education by forcing all teachers to use uniform lesson plans, by which all students will be guided in the same way at the same pace. This may be a comfort to young teachers who aren't sure what to do every day, but I already know the inevitable result of uniform teaching: things will continue to be uniformly terrible.<br><br>I've never been one of the masses, either as a parent or as a teacher. I will not let advertisers persuade me to see mediocre movies, and I do not watch a television show in order to converse with peers about it the following day. My life is my own. I don't feel I have to buy in to the popular culture in order to be a successful teacher, parent, or person. But there are those to whom fitting in with the majority is important, and I have respect for that path; it's just not the one I can follow, and these people may find the lessons I've learned irrelevant for their journey.<br><br>However, if you're a young teacher or parent who has often wanted to break from the pack but has been afraid to do so, I can tell you that I've done so and am still standing. I have many scars and bruises, but I have, as Robert Frost tells us, taken the road less traveled. And it's made all the difference.<br><br>Most teachers who are honest look back on their first years in the classroom through half-closed eyes. Teaching is a tough job at any time, and I've yet to meet anyone who excelled at it from the start. It takes years of experience to develop the wisdom that can lead to being a first-rate teacher.<br><br>I was definitely a slow learner, and I had an interesting but painful experience when I was student-teaching in UCLA's Graduate School of Education program. I thought I was doing a pretty good job and was vigorously supported by the master teacher who supervised my work in her sixth-grade classroom. She particularly liked the reading program I designed for the students, most of whom spoke Spanish as their primary language. Rather than using the boring school reader assigned by the school district, I'd been reading the classics with these kids, and their reading and enthusiasm for literature increased enormously. For our final project of the year, we read <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. My plan was to take the kids to the Franco Zeffirelli film on a weekend. It was playing in a revival house that showed classic films (this was before video made the showing of movies in class much easier).<br><br>The children got very excited about this trip and read <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> with gusto. They were devastated on the Friday we finished when our principal sent me a note tell- ing me he had heard about my plan but that it was strictly forbidden to take students out on a Saturday. He went on to threaten that if the trip went ahead as planned, I would not receive a positive evaluation at the end of my student-teaching assignment.<br><br>I was furious and just crumpled up his note. I had worked for two months to get the kids ready for this trip. Their parents were supportive, and many of them were coming to the movie with their children. I couldn't believe the head of a school would want to prevent his kids from having a rewarding climax to their experience with Shakespeare. Looking back, I laugh at myself that a decision like that surprised me. I was so young.<br><br>I stormed into the office, gave the crumpled note to the principal's secretary, and told her to tell him where he could stick it. That afternoon, when I arrived at UCLA for my education classes, I was informed by one of the instructors that I had been suspended until a committee could decide if I had the moral character to be a good teacher. The fact that the movie trip was canceled was the least of my problems.<br><br>I went home too angry to cry, and terrified at the thought of never teaching again. I had spent much of my life planning to be a teacher and now I had to consider the possibility that because of this stupid incident I might have to do something truly awful, like go to law school. This frustration was exacerbated when I received my first lesson in educational hypocrisy. There were rumors that the principal who was angry with me was having an affair with one of the teachers (they were both married), and that she was pregnant. Now, I'm no saint, but it was hard to have my moral integrity judged by this hypocrite.<br><br>To make a long story short, they allowed me to go on being a teacher if I completely discounted the last six months of student teaching and repeated them. To punish me, they had me supervised by a struggling new teacher who had often come to me for assistance when we were attending class together the previous year. Despite her self-acknowledged shortcomings as a classroom leader, she graduated on time and got a job immediately. Well, I give them credit: if their goal was to humble me and teach me my place, they did so. I learned quickly that I was in no position to talk back to principals.<br><br>I wanted to be a teacher so desperately that I swallowed my pride, said all the right things, and received my teach- ing credential the following year. I was so glad to survive this ordeal that I didn't take the time to consider the les- son I should have been learning. I still mistakenly believed that this incident was an unusual one, and that when I was actually teaching and being paid for it, I'd be supervised by caring and able people who had dedicated their lives to the betterment of young human beings. I didn't realize that many people, who may be good people, feel that working in schools is just a job and not a holy mission. Instead, I was more interested in the fact that within the next two years, the principal who had written me the note went through a divorce; his wife had never forgiven him when his illegitimate child was born. Sadly, a year later he was diagnosed with cancer and died soon after.<br><br>I had missed a crucial lesson here, but I would be given countless opportunities in the future to learn it. Public education is a mess, and I had survived my first scare by allowing the powers that be to force me to do exactly what they wanted.<br><br>This is a natural danger for many young teachers. In truth, for many of us the initial objective is just to survive; we hope our lessons go smoothly and the clock runs quickly. For many novice teachers, there is no more wonderful sound than the dismissal bell signaling the end of the day. Consequently, in far too many classrooms the children's edu- cation is not the main objective. Older teachers often mentor the young ones by teaching them survival tips that are fine for the beginning teacher but not helpful to the student. As a result, many young teachers believe they're doing a good job when in fact they're using smoke and mirrors. They have beautifully decorated classrooms with all the school standards created by some bureaucrat hanging on the wall. Their kids walk in straight lines, and order carries the day.<br><br>It is painful to reflect on this, because that was my classroom for the first couple of years, and I, too, thought I was doing a good job. What's more, the kids liked me. God, how foolish I feel now, remembering those desperate days. I actually worried more about the kids liking me than if they were reading well.<br><br>But I was fortunate. I had planned to teach at a school in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood. Instead, I was assigned to a middle-class school with middle-class parents and middle-class values. There were only three hundred children at this school, and everybody spoke English. The kids had private music lessons at home. Everyone was on a soccer team or in a drama club or in an orchestra on Saturdays. They went to school liking their teachers before they had met them. I used to joke with my friends and tell them that I taught at a school called Camelot. I felt wonderful, until one day, by accident, a very nice little girl said something to me that started me down a different path.<br><br>Our school was having a fund-raiser, and every teacher was supposed to contribute something for a silent auction. One teacher contributed tennis lessons; another was taking four kids to the movies. Since I loved Shakespeare, I planned a trip to the Old Globe Theater in San Diego for a group of about twenty-five students. The plan was for some parents, teachers, and me to drive the kids down for a weekend and two plays. The parents would pay for the trip and add about $25 extra. In this way the trip made a profit for the school while the kids had a good time and learned something.<br><br>And they did indeed. The trip ran like clockwork. We stayed at a beautiful hotel with a Hawaiian atmosphere. The kids swam in an Olympic-size pool in the afternoons and returned to their lovely and spacious rooms to change before dinner. We saw two terrific plays: Rashomon and a particularly hilarious <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>. A splendid time was had by all.<br><br>It was Sunday afternoon and we were heading to the cars for our return to Los Angeles. Walking next to a perky little girl named Jenny, I said to her, "Wasn't this a fun weekend?"<br><br>"It sure was, Rafe."<br><br>"Gorgeous hotel," I remarked.<br><br>"It was okay," Jenny answered vaguely. "It wasn't as nice as the ones I stay at in Hawaii and New York, but it was okay."<br><br>It didn't hit me like a thunderbolt at first, but all during the drive back to L.A., I kept thinking about this little girl's reaction to our weekend. I thought I had done something unique; I had wanted these days to mean something special to these kids and I had worked very hard to put it together. Yet the simple truth was that these were fortunate children who didn't need me doing this for them.<br><br>I spent the next few weeks observing my co-workers. Some of them were very good teachers; others were at best adequate. The majority of them took the path of least resistance. They were working with kids who were practically on autopilot and they were quite content to lay out the school textbooks, follow along chapter by chapter, and go home to their soap operas and bridge games with their social lives in order and consciences clear. There's nothing wrong with this, of course, but it was wrong for me.<br><br>As I was the new kid on the block, they often invited me out to dinner, and I started to realize that junior-high peer pressure was nothing compared to the pressures on teachers in an elementary school. "We read our books this way." "We teach history this way." "Do things this way, Rafe, and you'll get along well here."<br><br>They were right. Not only would I get along well, but also, at a rich school, the parents give you expensive presents at Christmas and at the end of the year. I was being paid for something I enjoyed doing, and still had health insurance and three months a year off. That's a good gig, but I wasn't happy. I started losing sleep and coming to school with knots in my stomach. Finally I figured out why this was happening. Camelot was too pleased with itself. The kids were good, but they weren't <i>that</i> good. The school had a sort of 1950s feel to it, which was fine, but an occasional new idea was seen as a threat to the established order. Still, I never spoke up when I observed certain songs being sung or dances being performed, even though I knew I had ideas that might be better. I had learned my place. Unfortunately, I also learned, to my shock, that a few of my fellow teachers routinely cheated on standardized examinations to inflate test scores and build the school's reputation in the community.<br><br>Early in my first year, I attended a staff meeting at which standardized tests were the main topic of discussion. In those days, children in California took an exam known as the SES, or Survey of Essential Skills. It was a very easy test assessing the most basic abilities. Children at Camelot were encouraged to get 100 percent on this test, and were given a "100%" button to wear around school if they did so.<br><br>After the meeting, two highly respected teachers took me aside to show me a teaching technique that would help my students maximize their performance. This test was a multiple-choice exam for which the students blacked in the bubbles next to the answers on a computerized form. The teachers had a grid of bubbles that could be placed over a student's answer sheet, and this grid's holes revealed only the correct answers, so that a teacher could immediately spot how many questions had been missed. In some classes, when students announced they had finished their tests, they were told to come up to the teacher's desk. The teacher would use her grid and tell the student that he or she "had missed three-go back, find your mistakes, and return your paper again when you think you have 100 percent."<br><br>"Isn't that cheating?" I asked timidly.<br><br>"Of course not," one teacher replied testily. "I'm not telling the children the answer or which problem they missed-I'm simply encouraging them to get all the answers right. If they do, our school looks better when the scores are printed in the newspapers. And the higher our test scores, the more money we receive for various programs."<br><br>I was too intimidated to talk back to this veteran, but I did summon the nerve to bring it up with my principal when we were alone in his office. I told him I could never administer a test that way, and planned just to encourage the kids to do their best; when they missed answers, it simply meant that I would have to reteach those skills. I hoped that was okay.<br><br>My principal shook his head and said that while he knew where I was coming from, he nevertheless was disappointed with my stubborn refusal to see the big picture. He said I had a lot to learn. I guess I did.<br><br>I learned one thing from testing my students honestly, though: I began to sleep better. I no longer had knots in my stomach when I came to school.<br><br>But I didn't have the wisdom or sense to articulate to myself that I was beginning to define my mission as a teacher. I didn't see the forest for the trees. Yet even in those early years, I was thinking a lot like Huck Finn, one of my heroes.<br><br>There's a marvelous s...</p><h2>ENGAGEMENT MAGIC: Five Keys for Engaging People, Leaders, and Organizations</h2><p><b>In this new edition, based on new research and double the survey data, <i>ENGAGEMENT MAGIC</i> provides you with an expert approach to increasing workplace engagement.</b> <br><br> <b>Discover how to engage employees (and yourself) more effectively.</b><br> Most leaders understand that engaged employees are passionate about their jobs and deliver better results, and most of us know what it's like to either be engaged or disengaged in a workplace where we spend most of our waking hours.

As a result, logic acquired a new and expanded significance for him. This text is thus the key to an understanding of the works of Hegel&#39;s maturity, and to their relation to the major works of Schelling and Fichte that preceded them. Scholars from the universities of Guelph, Lethbridge, McGill, McMaster, Toronto, Trent, and York have prepared this translation, a work of critical analysis in its own right. The introduction by H.S. Harris adds a concrete dimension to Hegel&#39;s abstract categories, showing how, in developing these categories, Hegel was even at ths early date thinking deeply about the structure and life of society.</p><p>CAText: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Song of the Crimson Flower</h2><p><b>From the acclaimed author of <i>Forest of a Thousand Lanterns </i>comes a fantastical new tale of darkness and love, in which magical bonds are stronger than blood.</b><br><br>Will love break the spell?

Quick, put out the light!&#x201d;<br><br>Her maid blew out the candles, plunging the bedroom into darkness, and Lan saw outside with a sudden sharp clarity: the great oaks sheltering the Vu family home, bending close together as though sharing a secret; the sunset-pink blossoms in the garden that smelled of summertime; and the grassy hill sloping down to the river two levels beneath her window. The warm breeze ran playful fingers through her long hair as she leaned out.<br><br>&#x201c;Be careful, miss!&#x201d; Chau begged. &#x201c;What will I tell your parents if you fall?&#x201d;<br><br>Lan brushed away the maid&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never fallen yet, have I? Hush, now.&#x201d;<br><br>A boat glided over the water and stopped near the riverbank. In the moonlight, Lan could only see a sliver of the young man&#x2019;s face, turned up toward her, and the shine of his bamboo flute. <i>Tam</i>, she thought, her mind caressing his beloved name. Her heart soared as he began to play, every sweet note ringing out as clearly as though he were in her room with her.<br><br>The music seemed a living, breathing thing. It whispered to her and danced in the air before her. The notes clung to her skin and the back of her throat. Lan pressed her hands against her flushed cheeks, thrilling at the beauty of it. Tam had come every night for two weeks and had played this song each time&#x2014;<i>her </i>song, the melody he had written for her. He had tucked the lyrics into the hollow of their favorite tree, and she had learned them by heart:<br><br><i>Little yellow flower,<br>You crossed the grass and the wind kissed every blade<br>Your feet had blessed.<br>I see springtime in the garden of your eyes.</i><br><br>The flute sang for her, and her alone. It was his voice, telling her in music what he had always been too shy to say in words: that he loved her, that he couldn&#x2019;t wait to spend his life with her, that both their families&#x2019; dearest hope was also his own. When he finished, he gazed up and lifted his hand to her, and Lan noticed the soft blue scarf tied around his wrist. She had given it to him along with a ruby dragonfly brooch, the heart-jewel a woman presented to her true love.<br><br>Chau, well versed in the routine by now, handed Lan several bundles of <i>hoa mai</i>. Lan kissed the sweet-smelling yellow flowers before tossing them to Tam. Most of them scattered on the surface of the water, but it was no matter. She knew he would gather each and every one, for she had watched him do it for fourteen nights. As she watched, he stooped to pluck a blossom from the river and kissed the petals her lips had touched.<br><br>The maid sighed. &#x201c;How lucky you are to have such a beautiful romance, miss.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; Lan said softly, stretching her hand to the boatman. She felt like a princess in the ancient ballads her father loved, with stars in her unbound hair. But the girls in those tales were always falling in love with men far beneath them. Tam was of a family equal to Lan&#x2019;s, and the prospect of their marriage was as close to their approving parents&#x2019; hearts as it was to their own. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s perfect, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br><br>If only he would find his courage. If only he would get past the shyness that forced him to express his feelings only in moonlit visits. In the two weeks since he started playing her music on the river, he had not come by once during the day. <i>He&#x2019;s busy learning how to become a great court minister like his uncle</i>, she told herself sternly. <i>It&#x2019;s silly to complain when he is building a good life for us.</i> Tam was devoted to her, and when the time was right, he would finally allow the fortune-teller to choose an auspicious date for their wedding. In the meantime, she would try to learn patience and understanding, two of her mother&#x2019;s strongest qualities.<br><br>As though Lan&#x2019;s thoughts had called her, Lady Vu&#x2019;s footsteps sounded in the corridor. &#x201c;Why is it so dark in here?&#x201d; she asked, entering her daughter&#x2019;s room. Two servants flanked her, their lanterns illuminating the crisp turquoise silk of her long, gold-collared <i>ao dai</i>. The overdress fluttered against her cream trousers. &#x201c;What on earth are you looking at?&#x201d;<br><br>Lan jumped back from the window. &#x201c;Nothing, Mama. Just stargazing.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t have to fib; her parents approved of her betrothal to Tam, after all, and there was nothing improper about these visits. But she was nearly eighteen, and Ba and Mama allowed her so few secrets from them; she wanted these nights of moonlight and music to belong to her and Tam alone. &#x201c;I was thinking about Tam and how hard he works.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you were, my love,&#x201d; Lady Vu said, her face softening. &#x201c;I am certain your wedding will take place soon. You needn&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not worried,&#x201d; Lan answered, but it sounded forced even to her ears.<br><br>Her mother signaled for the servants to relight the candles, and the room in which Lan had grown up came back into view: the bright oak walls, the yellow-and-white embroidered rug, and the cheerful gold silk pillows on the bed. Lady Vu patted a lacquered sandalwood chair. &#x201c;Sit. I will brush your hair,&#x201d; she said, and the servants left the room to allow mother and daughter their nightly chat. She ran the teeth of the ivory comb tenderly through Lan&#x2019;s hair. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be a happy wife and mother, like me. You have nothing to fear from your Tam.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know he cares for me, Mama.&#x201d; Lan fixed her eyes on the night sky, imagining Tam gathering flowers on the river outside and watching the square of light from her room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just eager for a wedding date to be chosen. If there&#x2019;s a task to be done, better to do it right away.&#x201d;<br><br>Lady Vu laughed. &#x201c;How like your dear father you are in that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And like you in my face,&#x201d; Lan returned, lifting an ornate bronze hand mirror. Her face and her mother&#x2019;s looked back at her, both rosy and round with wide noses and wider eyes, dark and shining as the river. Even their dimpled smiles were the same.<br><br>Her mother stroked her hair. &#x201c;Master and Madam Huynh have always spoiled Tam. He&#x2019;s their only son, which is why they indulge him in everything. Ba and I know better than to give your brothers such freedom. We are their parents, and we know best.&#x201d; She set the comb down and met Lan&#x2019;s eyes in the mirror. &#x201c;Tam may be shy, but his nerves will soon pass.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think that&#x2019;s why he keeps putting off the fortune-teller?&#x201d; Lan asked, turning to look at her. &#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s nervous about marrying me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it has anything to do with you, my treasure.&#x201d; Lady Vu laid a hand on her daughter&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Some men are still children at twenty, and Tam may be feeling anxious about the responsibilities he will take on as a husband and head of a household.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was Ba anxious?&#x201d;<br><br>The older woman smiled. &#x201c;No. But he has always been a decisive person.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He left flowers for you every day after you were betrothed,&#x201d; Lan said, remembering Ba&#x2019;s story. It was both funny and sweet to imagine her proper, formal father as a youth in love.<br><br>&#x201c;Your father and I were well matched from the start. Sharing my life with him has been a joy, and I want that happiness for you,&#x201d; Lady Vu said, squeezing Lan&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Ba will speak to the Huynhs and see if they can&#x2019;t push Tam a bit. It&#x2019;s long past time to choose a wedding date.&#x201d;<br><br>Three dates had been proposed by the fortune-teller and all refused by Tam. The first had landed in the middle of the rain season, which he insisted was not a propitious time to marry. The next had fallen too close to the Festival of the New Year, which might have symbolized a fresh beginning, but Tam had insisted it would be disrespectful to the gods to celebrate a marriage instead of spending time in reflection and prayer. And the third date&#x2014;for which both the Huynhs and Vus had pushed&#x2014;had been in the winter, and Tam did not wish his bride to be cold and uncomfortable in the journey to her new home. No matter that the Huynhs lived only on the other side of the river, no more than a half hour&#x2019;s journey by palanquin.<br><br>Lan had been disappointed each time, but had excused these concerns as proof of Tam&#x2019;s thoughtful, conscientious nature. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s superstitious, and also cautious,&#x201d; she told her mother now. &#x201c;Our marriage will be the most important event of his life, and he wants it to be perfect.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course he does. Ba will speak to Tam&#x2019;s parents, and by year&#x2019;s end, you will be a bride.&#x201d; Lady Vu dimpled. &#x201c;Just think of the finery you&#x2019;ll wear and how beautiful you&#x2019;ll look. The first of your cousins to marry, even though you&#x2019;re the youngest. How jealous they will be.&#x201d;<br><br>Lan beamed, picturing herself in her festive red wedding clothes and gold headdress. &#x201c;Will you lend me your jade necklace, Mama?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Better than that. I will give it to you as a gift,&#x201d; her mother said indulgently. &#x201c;And we will have B� Trang add <i>ten </i>times the gold embroidery to your wedding clothes. They&#x2019;ll be so much prettier than the hideous silks B� Danh&#x2019;s great-niece wore at her wedding.&#x201d; They giggled at the great-niece&#x2019;s expense and sat up late together, gossiping and planning for the future.<br><br>When Lady Vu finally retired for the night, Lan gazed out at the star-dappled river, now empty of her passionate boatman. As a child, she had sat by this window with her grandmother, making up wild stories about all the adventures she would have as a bold, brave young woman. B� n&#x1ed9;i had loved tales of daring quests and far-off lands and had transferred her passion to Lan, encouraging her to dream and imagine herself as strong and courageous as anyone in the old legends. But B� n&#x1ed9;i had died last summer, leaving an empty place in Lan&#x2019;s heart where her grandmother&#x2019;s love and her thirst for adventure had once been.<br><br>It made Lan feel lonesome and a little sad, wondering when she had changed so much. But she supposed that letting go of her flights of fancy and her desire to see the world came with growing up. <i>And getting married will be an adventure, too</i>, she told herself.<br><br>The pieces of her life were falling perfectly into place. Soon, she would make Ba and Mama proud, and she would have everything: a lovely, elegant wing of the Huynhs&#x2019; home, servants to tend to her every wish as a cherished daughter-in-law, and Tam, the handsome young man who wove his love for her into the melody of a flute beneath the moon.</p><h2>Introduction to Forensic Anthropology: A Textbook</h2><p>This new book offers comprehensive coverage of all the major topics in the field of forensics with accuracy, intensity, and clarity.

Given the modern pluralistic world we live in, why is evangelicalism so popular?<br> <br> Based on a national telephone survey and more than three hundred personal interviews with evangelicals and other churchgoing Protestants, this study provides a detailed analysis of the commitments, beliefs, concerns, and practices of this thriving group. Examining how evangelicals interact with and attempt to influence secular society, this book argues that traditional, orthodox evangelicalism endures not despite, but precisely because of, the challenges and structures of our modern pluralistic environment. This work also looks beyond evangelicalism to explore more broadly the problems of traditional religious belief and practice in the modern world.<br> <br> With its impressive empirical evidence, innovative theory, and substantive conclusions, <i>American Evangelicalism</i> will provoke lively debate over the state of religious practice in contemporary America.<br></p></p><p><i>American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving</i> by sociologist Christian Smith tells a very different story about evangelicals from the one most people believe. Most of us know that evangelical churches are growing fast. Many pundits have suggested that evangelicalism is thriving because it's an easy way out of dealing with the complexities of the modern world--it's a place where everyone is pretty much the same: not too well educated, not too upwardly mobile, and more or less frightened of the amorality that's supposedly flourishing in contemporary America. Yet Christian Smith's study, based on thousands of interviews and extensive polling, argues that evangelicalism is growing "very much because of and not in spite of its confrontation with modern pluralism." He disproves the demographic caricature of evangelicals that's been drawn by conventional wisdom, showing evangelicals to be better educated than most of those calling themselves religious liberals, and establishing that their moral concerns are mostly exercised on behalf of others--most evangelicals don't believe they or their families are really threatened by modern life. Therefore, Smith's study proposes that American evangelicals have created a subculture characterized by "both high tension and high integration into mainstream society simultaneously." And as a result, "Contemporary pluralism creates a situation in which evangelicals can perpetually maintain but never resolve their struggle with the non-evangelical world." It's a fascinating idea, and one that should prompt readers to wonder whether evangelicals actually enjoy playing a divinized version of devil's advocate in contemporary American life. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>Christian Smith</b> is the William R.

A New Stoicism proposes an answer to that question, offered from within the stoic tradition but without the metaphysical and psychological assumptions that modern philosophy and science have abandoned. Lawrence Becker argues that a secular version of the stoic ethical project, based on contemporary cosmology and developmental psychology, provides the basis for a sophisticated form of ethical naturalism, in which virtually all the hard doctrines of the ancient Stoics can be clearly restated and defended. Becker argues, in keeping with the ancients, that virtue is one thing, not many; that it, and not happiness, is the proper end of all activity; that it alone is good, all other things being merely rank-ordered relative to each other for the sake of the good; and that virtue is sufficient for happiness. Moreover, he rejects the popular caricature of the stoic as a grave figure, emotionally detached and capable mainly of endurance, resignation, and coping with pain. To the contrary, he holds that while stoic sages are able to endure the extremes of human suffering, they do not have to sacrifice joy to have that ability, and he seeks to turn our attention from the familiar, therapeutic part of stoic moral training to a reconsideration of its theoretical foundations.</p><p><p>"An effective antidote to the caricatures of Stoic theory which still infect the literary and philosophical world. . . . <i>A New Stoicism</i> is a fine contribution to the theory and practice of philosophical therapy."<b>--<i></i>Stephen R.

Navigating the vast database in geriatric psychopharmacology is a daunting task at best, leaving many clinicians overwhelmed and confused -- and opening the door to potentially dangerous consequences for some of our most fragile patients.</p><p>Clinicians can now turn to this definitive handbook for answers. Here, three experienced pharmacologists provide a truly practical "how to" guide to prescribing medications in the geriatric population, drawing on their own clinical experience and their reading of the literature in geriatric psychopharmacology.</p><p>Unlike other hardcover-only references in this field, this concise handbook is replete with valuable advice (e.g., drug dosing, titration) for day-to-day clinical practice, including strategies for improving compliance among the elderly. Also included are unique quick-reference summaries of prescribing data on selected drugs in each class. ? The introduction focuses on the essentials of geriatric pharmacokinetics and a general approach to geriatric prescribing, offering guidelines on how to improve compliance in the elderly.? The next four chapters each cover a major psychotropic class of medications -- antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic medications -- including information about pharmacology (baseline labs), clinical use (drug titration), side effects, and treatment. Here, at the end of each of these chapters, you'll find the unique "quick-reference" summaries of prescribing data for selected drugs in each class.?

This collection's editors are all connected with the Freedom Project; Berlin is the coordinator. The letters, reports and depositions included here, largely drawn from Union records, tell at first hand the human story of African Americans in the Civil War, which, the editors contend, was also a second American revolution. Between 1861 and 1865 government was transformed, citizienship redefined, social classes rearranged--and blacks were at the center of the process. The texts offered have a common denominator: the determination displayed by African American men and women to control their own destinies, especially in relations with whites.

It was, therefore, incumbent upon them to fulfill what they understood to be God's plan: to reestablish Christian control of Syria and Palestine. This book is devoted to the resulting settlements, the crusader states, that developed around the eastern shores of the Mediterranean and survived until Richard the Lionheart's departure in 1192. Focusing on Jerusalem, Antioch, Tripoli, and Edessa, Malcolm Barber vividly reconstructs the crusaders' arduous process of establishing and protecting their settlements, and the simultaneous struggle of vanquished inhabitants to adapt to life alongside their conquerors.</p><p>Rich with colorful accounts of major military campaigns, the book goes much deeper, exploring in detail the culture of the crusader states&#x2014;the complex indigenous inheritance; the architecture; the political, legal, and economic institutions; the ecclesiastical framework through which the crusaders perceived the world; the origins of the Knights Templar and the Hospitallers; and more.

Ronald L. Numbers chronicles the astonishing resurgence of this belief since the 1960s, as well as the creationist movement's tangled roots in the theologies of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Baptists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Adventists, and other religious groups.<br><br>Even more remarkable than Numbers's story of today's widespread rejection of the theory of evolution is the dramatic shift from acceptance of the earth's antiquity to the insistence of present-day scientific creationists that most fossils date back to Noah's flood and its aftermath, and that the earth itself is not more than ten thousand years old. Numbers traces the evolution of scientific creationism and shows how the creationist movement challenges the very meaning of science.</p><p>&#34;For those interested in the background of the modern revival of creationism, whether evolutionists or creationists, this book is a rich mine of information and historical insights.&#34; (Henry M.

It discusses the interpretation of Plato&#39;s Timaeus by Cicero, Apuleius, Calcidius, and Augustine, and examines how these authors created new contexts and settings for the intellectual heritage they received and thereby contributed to the construction of the complex and multifaceted genre of Roman Platonism. It takes advantage of the authors&#39; treatment of Plato&#39;s Timaeus as a continuous point of reference to illustrate the individuality and originality of each writer in his engagement with this Greek philosophical text; each chooses a specific vocabulary, methodology, and literary setting for his appropriation of Timaean doctrine. The authors&#39; contributions to the dialogue&#39;s history of transmission are shown to have enriched and prolonged the enduring significance of Plato&#39;s cosmology.</p><p>The book explores the development of Platonic philosophy by Roman writers between the first century BCE and the early fifth century CE.

The diversity of artists represented--hailing from South America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and the United States--serves to critique and recuperate this concept of the Baroque that has become increasingly cliched and misunderstood. With art by Ruben Ortiz Torres, Miguel Calderon, Rochelle Costi, Arturo Duclos, Carlos Garaica, Meyer Vaisman, Yishai Jusidman, Iiigo Manglano-Ovalle, La Menna Barreto and Franco Mondini Ruiz among many others, <i>Ultrabaroque</i> proposes a fresh angle on Latin American art.</p><p>Though utterly at odds in their approaches, these two works together present perhaps the fullest understanding of Latin American art available for the least shelf space. Barnitz (modern Latin American art, Univ. of Texas, Austin) offers a straightforward, essentially chronological account of the most important styles and artists from Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, and most of South America. She acknowledges, without quite justifying, the exclusion of art from other Central American and Caribbean countries. More regrettably, only mid-century architecture makes an appearance, and the relation of the plastic arts to performing arts is not considered. However, a book of such scope is necessarily selective, and Barnitz makes up for these failings by forging a coherent overview. Most importantly, her tone is consistent but nondogmatic as she positions the major currents of the century from 1890 to 1990 within the Western tradition, not subjugated to it or exotically distinct. The only real shortcoming is the quality of the illustrations (105 in color, 204 in black and white), which can be muddled and flat. Cocurators Armstrong and Zamudio-Taylor present a sumptuous, bilingual package to accompany their show of contemporary art, which will travel from San Diego's Museum of Contemporary Art to Fort Worth, San Francisco, Toronto, Miami, and Minneapolis over the next two years. The catalog at the heart of the book highlights 15 artists from all over Latin America; each is given six pages with bright, clear illustrations of a few pieces and analytical essays. The works of these young artists (the oldest is 44) are all of very high caliber and represent diverse styles and media. Some will be well known to those who keep up with the contemporary scene, while others have had little exposure in the United States. Surrounding this core are four equally fine essays investigating the curatorial theme of the Baroque the style's historical impact from the colonial period, its frequently derogatory application to a perceived Latin taste for ornamentation, and its actual relevance to the selected artists. Beyond the checklist and artist biographies, the end matter further enhances the book with a 20-page "sourcebook" containing short writings from the last five centuries on both Latin colonization and the concept of the Baroque. Both books are highly recommended for all academic and most medium and large public libraries.

Seeking to understand life&#x2019;s connection to the stars, David Deamer introduces astrobiology, a new scientific discipline that studies the origin and evolution of life on Earth and relates it to the birth and death of stars, planet formation, interfaces between minerals, water, and atmosphere, and the physics and chemistry of carbon compounds. Deamer argues that life began as systems of molecules that assembled into membrane-bound packages. These in turn provided an essential compartment in which more complex molecules assumed new functions required for the origin of life and the beginning of evolution. Deamer takes us from the vivid and unpromising chaos of the Earth four billion years ago up to the present and his own laboratory, where he contemplates the prospects for generating synthetic life. Engaging and accessible, <i>First Life</i> describes the scientific story of astrobiology while presenting a fascinating hypothesis to explain the origin of life.</p><p>"The origin of life may have happened an inconceivably long time ago, but scientists like David Deamer are making major advances in understanding how the first microbes began to seethe on our planet, ultimately giving rise to all species alive today.

He provides limited textual information, with significant illustrations and maps scattered throughout.

With &#34;Love, Sex, Fear, Death,&#34; Parfrey has captured the cooperation of primary players in the most secretive and talked about cult of our time."It is an unglamorous saga of indentured panhandling, Dumpster-diving, child neglect, public-access proselytizing, and Heathers-level Machiavellianism&#x2014;detailing the insidious banality of evil more convincingly than Process theology or Maury Terry ever could."&#x2014;<i>LA Weekly</i><br></p><h2>Step-by-Step Writing Book 3: A Standards-Based Approach</h2><p>Step-by-Step Writing: A Standards-Based Approach is a four-level series uniquely designed to cover the same genres across all levels.

A failure in all respects, the operation ended in disaster, and the Allied forces suffered some 390,000 casualties. This conclusive book assesses the many myths that have emerged about Gallipoli and provides definitive answers to questions that have lingered about the operation.</p><p>Robin Prior, a renowned military historian, proceeds step by step through the campaign, dealing with naval, military, and political matters and surveying the operations of all the armies involved: British, Anzac, French, Indian, and Turkish. Relying substantially on original documents, including neglected war diaries and technical military sources, Prior evaluates the strategy, the commanders, and the performance of soldiers on the ground. His conclusions are powerful and unsettling: the naval campaign was not &#x201c;almost&#x201d; won, and the land action was not bedeviled by &#x201c;minor misfortunes.&#x201d; Instead, the badly conceived Gallipoli campaign was doomed from the start. And even had it been successful, the operation would not have shortened the war by a single day. Despite their bravery, the Allied troops who fell at Gallipoli died in vain.</p></p><p><b>Robin Prior</b> is visiting professorial fellow, University of Adelaide, and visiting fellow, University of New South Wales, Australian Defence Force Academy.

Examining a broad range of writings, G. M. Hamburg shows why Russia&#x2019;s enlightenment constituted a precondition for the explosive emergence of nineteenth-century writers such as Fedor Dostoyevsky and Vladimir Soloviev.</p><p>&#x201c;This patient and persuasive book is the indispensible prehistory to the Russia we think we know, a country whose politics constantly disappoints. Hamburg does not whitewash that politics. But he does remind us that the Kantian values of autonomy, self-mastery, and secular reason are not the only Enlightenment possible; however imperfectly realized, more potent in Russia have always been the ideals of spiritual illumination and applied Christian ethics. This is intellectual history at its most empathetic, full of personal stories but without ever losing its analytic edge.&#x201d;&#x2014;Caryl Emerson, Princeton University (Caryl Emerson)<br><br>&#x201c;This is the first comprehensive, in-depth survey of political thought in Russia from medieval times until the end of the eighteenth century. Hamburg does not subscribe to the usual interpretation of ever-increasing secularization and Europeanization. His account is more refined, and more convincing: Western thought sharpened Russian conceptual categories without completely erasing them. There was an enlightenment, but an indigenous one. This book will not be surpassed for years.&#x201d;--Manfred Hildermeier, University of G�ttingen (Manfred Hildermeier)<br><br>"Closely examining every important Russian thinker over a period of more than three hundred years, including several autocrats, Professor Hamburg has produced a magisterial grand narrative, from which there emerges a fresh interpretation of the Russian Enlightenment that will have enduring value for students of Russian intellectual history."-- Derek Offord, University of Bristol (Derek Offord)</p><h2>Dumb Witness</h2><p>John Moffatt stars as Hercule Poirot, with Simon Williams as Captain Hastings. (This work comes with music specially composed by Tom Smail.) As Hercule Poirot sifts through his post one particular morning, he alights upon a letter from an elderly and (as it transpires), exceedingly rich spinster -- Miss Emily Arundell. She is clearly in great distress and seeking his help, but doesnt say why. Her only specific mention is the incident of the dogs ball. However, what intrigues Poirot is the date of the communication -- it was written two months ago. He persuades Captain Hastings that they must visit the lady with all haste. On arrival, they discover that she has died, apparently of natural causes. But Bob, Miss Arundells devoted wire-haired terrier, knows better. And so, soon, does Poirot.</p><p><p>Everyone blamed Emily Arundell&#x2019;s accident on a rubber ball left on the stairs by her frisky terrier.

It has remained unpublished, in any language, until now. </p><p>In his exegesis and critical interpretation of Kant's <i>Anthropology</i>, Foucault raises the question of the relation between psychology and anthropology, and how they are affected by time. Though a Kantian "critique of the anthropological slumber," Foucault warns against the dangers of treating psychology as a new metaphysics, explores the possibilities of studying man empirically, and reflects on the nature of time, art and technique, self-perception, and language. Extending Kant's suggestion that any empirical knowledge of man is inextricably tied up with language, Foucault asserts that man is a world citizen insofar as he speaks. For both Kant and Foucault, anthropology concerns not the human animal or self-consciousness but, rather, involves the questioning of the limits of human knowledge and concrete existence. </p><p>This long-unknown text is a valuable contribution not only to a scholarly appreciation of Kant's work but as the first outline of what would later become Foucault's own frame of reference within the history of philosophy. It is thus a definitive statement of Foucault's relation to Kant as well as Foucault's relation to the critical tradition of philosophy. By going to the heart of the debate on structuralist anthropology and the status of the human sciences in relation to finitude, Foucault also creates something of a prologue to his foundational <i>The Order of Things.</i> </p><p>Michel Foucault (1926&#x2013;84) is widely considered to be one of the most important academic voices of the twentieth century and has proven influential across disciplines.</p></p><p>Michel Foucault (1926&#x2013;84) is widely considered to be one of the most influential academic voices of the twentieth century and has proven influential across disciplines.</p><h2>The Sirens of Surrentum (The Roman Mysteries)</h2><p><p>Mystery and adventure for four young detectives in Ancient Roman times...</p><p>It's summer in the Bay of Naples - time for fun and relaxation.

As Judith Duerk powerfully shows, the world is crying out for a developed Feminine voice, a voice that can mediate, once again, the ancient values of the Feminine. These are values of interiority and of the sacredness of the earth, that honor the privacy of individual process; values of the deeper Self held within us all. Many women experience a battle within themselves between the critical, dismissing voice of their masculine side and the interior, self-sustaining voice of their feminine side. Without coming to terms and seeking balance with our masculine side, our feminine side can never reach its full potential. For those seeking balance between the masculine urge to DO and the feminine desire to BE, Duerk&#39;s mixture of prose, poetry, and reflective questions creates a model for integration.</p><p></p><h2>Splendors of the Universe: A Practical Gudie to Photographing the Night Sky</h2><p><p> Catch a Falling Star--With a Camera Majestic clouds of cosmic gas floating in constellations ... the elegant swirl of a remote spiral galaxy ... the Milky Way's ethereal glow on a cool summer night.

More than a photo album, <b>Splendors of the Universe</b> provides information on the objects displayed as well as the details of how each picture was taken. </p><p> Astrophotography experts Terence Dickinson and Jack Newton offer a wealth of practical information and tips about techniques and equipment for both the novice and experienced photographers. </p></p><p><i>Splendors of the Universe</i> is a celebration of the beauty of the universe as captured by cameras and telescopes in the hands of amateur astronomers. From the radiance of an aurora to the majesty of a total eclipse of the Sun or the subtle wisps of a galactic nebula, the universe has a deep visual appeal. Every picture you see on these pages was taken by an astronomy enthusiast, someone -- perhaps like you -- who decided to frame a celestial scene, opened the camera shutter for a few seconds or minutes and was pleasantly surprised by the results. <p>And there lies the second objective of this book: practical information to guide you in your own astrophotography endeavors. We have tried to cover it all, from the simplest camera-on-tripod constellation shooting to the use of state-of-the-art telescopes and CCD cameras. A surprising number of the universe's visual treasures can be captured with relatively modest equipment. Of course, other targets require expensive and/or highly specialized gear. But no matter where you are in your personal trek into astrophotography, you will find useful tips and guidance on these pages. </p><p>One particular emphasis in this book, which we haven't seen covered to any extent in other astrophotography books, is the how-to aspect of creative photography-attempting to realize the maximum possible splendor in the astronomical shot. To that end, we wanted to supply plenty of examples, making these pages delightful to took at as well as information-packed. Each of us has spent thousands of hours at our telescopes over several decades, many of them devoted to adding that next elusive photo to our collection. But we wouldn't do it if we didn't thoroughly enjoy the challenge.</p><p> <b>Terence Dickinson</b> is the best-selling author of <i>Nightwatch</i> and <i>The Backyard Astronomer's Guide</i>.

In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

While he is perhaps best known for his fanciful, macabre books, such as <i>The Doubtful Guest</i> and The <i>Gashlycrumb Tinies</i>, his instantly recognizable imagery can be seen everywhere from the <i>New Yorker</i> to the opening title sequence of the television series <i>Mystery!</i> on PBS. <i>Gorey's Worlds</i> delves into the numerous and surprising cultural and artistic sources that influenced Gorey's unique visual language.&nbsp;</p><p>Gorey was an inveterate collector--he called it "accumulating." A variety of objects shaped his artistic mindset, from works of popular culture to the more than twenty-six thousand books he owned and the art pieces in his vast collection. This collection, which Gorey left to the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art upon his death, is diverse in style, subject, and media, and includes prints by Eug�ne Delacroix, Charles Meryon, Edvard Munch, and Odilon Redon; photographs by Eug�ne Atget; and drawings by Balthus, Pierre Bonnard, Charles Burchfield, Bill Traylor, and �douard Vuillard. As this book shows, these artistic pieces present a visual riddle, as the connections between them&#x2015;to each other and to Gorey's works&#x2015;are significant and enigmatic. The essays in <i>Gorey's Worlds</i> also examine the artist's consuming passions for animals and ballet.</p><p>Featuring a sumptuous selection of Gorey's creations alongside his fascinating and diverse collections, <i>Gorey's Worlds</i> reveals the private world that inspired one of the most idiosyncratic artists of the twentieth century.</p><p>Exhibition Schedule: Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, February 10 - May 6, 2018</p></p><p><p> "<i>Gorey's Worlds</i> illuminates the complex creations of artist Edward Gorey by examining his art collection, his love of dance, his linguistic play, and his images of animals.

First published in 1956, it arose from Richard Wright&#39;s participation in a global conference held in Bandung, Indonesia, in April 1955. With this report of what occurred at Bandung Wright takes a central spot on the international stage and serves as a harbinger of worldwide social and political change. He exhorts Western nations, largely responsible for the poverty and ignorance in their former colonies, to destroy racial impediments and to work with the leadership of the new nations in moving toward modernization and industrialization under a free democratic system rather than under Communist totalitarianism. With this book, Wright became a precursor to the era of multiculturalism and an advocate for global transformation.</p><p>"It seems probable that no white Westerner, no African or Asian could have summoned up sufficient objectivity to write it," said LJ's reviewer (LJ 1/15/56).

In lieu of the theological, sociological, and psychoanalytic approaches that have generally dominated the study of ecstatic mystical experiences, the authors endeavor to decode the brain mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Arzy and Idel analyze first-person descriptions to explore the Kabbalistic techniques employed by most prominent Jewish mystics to effect bodily reduplications, dissociations, and other phenomena, and compare them with recent neurological observations and modern-day laboratory experiments. The resultant study offers readers a scientific, more brain-based understanding of how ecstatic Kabbalists achieved their most precious mystical experiences. The study further demonstrates how these Kabbalists have long functioned as pioneering investigators of the human self.</p><p><b>Shahar Arzy</b> is the director of the Computational Neuropsychiatry Lab at the Faculty of Medicine at Hebrew University, Jerusalem and a senior neurologist at the Department of Neurology, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center. <b>Moshe Idel </b>is Max Cooper Professor in Jewish Thought in the Department of Jewish Thought at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and senior researcher at the Shalom Hartman Institute."In this thought-provoking book, the authors present compelling evidence that over hundreds of years, a group of Jewish mystics mastered techniques to probe and potentially unlock the secrets of human consciousness, mind and body, sense of self, and ecstatic experiences."&#x2014;Steven C.

The Mining Law illuminates some of the more obscure corners of Western history, federal land and resource policy, and the relationships among various branches of government in making and carrying out policy.<br>For more than a century the mining of hard-rock minerals in the United States has been carried out under this law, which was written to promote mineral development in the age of the pick-and-shovel prospector. It is the last important survivor of the great laws undergirding the westward expansion. The Mining Law has never been changed to reflect modern mining technologies or newer social values that question whether mineral extraction is the best use of the land and its resources. From its enactment, the Mining Law's inadequacies have given rise to illegal abuse, litigation, and patchwork regulation by federal agencies and judge-made law. Leshy explains how the law has survived by a combination of executive and judicial manipulation in the face of legislative paralysis. Today, as concern mounts about economic efficiency, government regulation, environmental protection, the rebuilding of the nation's industrial base, and competing uses of the land and its resources, the argument for reform of the law becomes compelling. The present law not only obstructs the very mineral development it was designed to promote; it may no longer be in the national interest. Certainly any future attempts to rewrite or amend the Law will start off with Leshy's exposition and analysis of its origins, operation, and implementation, and his detailed examination of the issues surrounding the law, its interpretation by courts and administrative agencies, and the attempts to adapt the law to changing conditions and social goals. Assessing the prospect for reform in today's political climate, he suggests arrangements regarding the law's reform that might be concluded by industry, small operators, and environmental protection advocates as well as creative measures that might be taken by Congress, the president, and the courts.</p><p>&#39;A definitive account of federal mining policy from the era of the California Gold Rush to the present. Major legislative reform is urgently needed. . . and Leshy concludes this lucid and judicious legal study with some constructive policy recommendations.&#39; Western Library &#39;In this comprehensive and quite readable volume [the author] relates how, if not entirely why, the mining law became, in the words of an early critic, a perpetual motion machine seemingly designed to promote litigation, create controversy, and occasional difficulties.&#39; Amicus Journal &#39;Sufficiently technical and scholarly to be useful for lawyers and at the same time sufficiently free of jargon and clearly organized so as to be understandable to nonlawyers.&#39; Rural Development Perspectives</p><h2>Face Value: Portraiture in the Age of Abstraction</h2><p><p><i>Reports of its death were exaggerated but persistent in the art world; in mid-twentieth century America, everyone seemed to agree that portraiture was finished as a progressive art form.</i></p><p>A groundbreaking reassessment of the reinvention of portraiture in America between 1945 and 1975&#x2014;the period when the abstract expressionists reached international prominence&#x2014;this new volume presents fifty-five innovative portrait paintings, drawings, prints, and sculptures.

Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the <i>Tales</i> has been translated into modern idiom. <p> From the heroic romance of "The Knight's Tale" to the low farce embodied in the stories of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant, Chaucer treated such universal subjects as love, sex, and death in poetry that is simultaneously witty, insightful, and poignant. <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is a grand tour of 14th-century English mores and morals--one that modern-day readers will enjoy.</p>This textbook series provides concise and lucid introductions to major works of literature, from classical antiquity to the twentieth century. Each book provides close reading of the text, as well as giving a full account of its historical, cultural and intellectual background, a discussion of its influence, and further reading.</p><h2>Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach</h2><p><p><i>Programming Massively Parallel Processors</i> discusses the basic concepts of parallel programming and GPU architecture.

But few have written of crossing&#x2014;completely and entirely&#x2014;the gender line. <i>Crossing</i> is the story of Deirdre McCloskey (formerly Donald), once a golden boy of conservative economics and a child of 1950s and 1960s privilege, and her dramatic and poignant journey to becoming a woman. McCloskey's account of her painstaking efforts to learn to "be a woman" unearth fundamental questions about gender and identity, and hatreds and anxieties, revealing surprising answers.</p></p><p>This fascinating memoir chronicles Deirdre McCloskey's transformation from Donald McCloskey, an economist at the University of Iowa and married father of two, into the woman he finally accepted he had always wanted to be. McCloskey had been dressing in women's clothes since he was 11, but after his daughter went to college in 1994, the 52-year-old man grew increasingly aware that he was more than "just a heterosexual crossdresser." As he moved toward the decision to become a transsexual, his wife reacted angrily, and his sister tried twice to have him declared insane. The passages detailing McCloskey's ordeal within the psychiatric and legal establishment are as gripping as a topnotch thriller. But the memoir's deeper interest lies in the author's reflections on the nature of gender and identity. Donald was a macho academic who dominated every discussion, viewing conversation as an exercise in one-upmanship. As he surgically altered his appearance and began to take estrogen on the road to "The Operation," he found himself relating to people in a more conventionally female way: listening to others, considering feelings. "The hormones are working, he thought at first. Or was it merely that the real person could now stand up?... Biology or core identity?" There are no final answers to such questions, but McCloskey poses them with sensitivity and insight. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>A renowned economist and historian, a husband and father, Donald McCloskey (now Deirdre) had crossdressed for years without wanting more. But at age fifty-two a sense that he was denying his real identity grew to the point where he knew he had to become a woman. <i>Crossing</i> is the poignant story of this realization and its consequences.</p><h2>The Complete Short Stories: The 1950s</h2><p><p>In a major publishing project, all of Brian Aldiss&#x2019; 300+ short stories are being collected together for the first time.</p><p>Volume one takes us from his very first story &#x2013; A Book in Time, published in The Bookseller in 1954 and never seen again until now &#x2013; right up to his establishment as a major new voice in science fiction by the end of that decade.</p><p>As he enters his 89th year this is a long-overdue retrospective of the career of one of the most acclaimed science fiction writers of all time, and a true literary legend.</p></p><p>Brian Aldiss, OBE, is a fiction and science fiction writer, poet, playwright, critic, memoirist and artist.

Curtis: Coming to Light</h2><p>Bold, sometimes abrasive, forever passionate, Edward Curtis was the quintessential romantic visionary. Curtis struggled through an impoverished boyhood in Minnesota to become a successful society photographer in Seattle. But he soon moved far beyond weddings and studio portraits to his life&#x2019;s work&#x2014;a multi-volume photographic and ethnogrpahic work on the vanishing world of the North American Indian. Initially, Teddy Roosevelt and J.P. Morgan backed the ambitious project. But as the work stretched over years, Curtis found himself alone with his vision, struggling to finance himself and his crews. The 20-volume North American Indians, finally completed in 1930, cost Curtis his marriage, his friendships, his home, and his health. By the time he died in 1952, he and his monumental work had lapsed into obscurity. In this richly designed book, Anne Makepeace, creator of an award-winning documentary on Curtis&#x2019;s life, reexamines the lasting impact of his work. Curtis&#x2019;s photographs, once ignored, now serve as a link between the romantic past and contemporary Native American communities, who have used his images to reclaim and resurrect their traditions.</p><p></p><h2>The Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind: Prima Collector&#39;s Edition Guide</h2><p><p><b>Includes a Rufous Mudcrab pet DLC!</b> Explore Morrowind with the Rufous Mudcrab!

Evangelicals are radically individualist, but devoted to community and family. They believe in the transformative power of a personal relationship with God, but are wary of religious enthusiasm. They are deeply skeptical of secular reason, but eager to find scientific proof that the Bible is true. <br><br>In this groundbreaking history of modern American evangelicalism, Molly Worthen argues that these contradictions are the products of a crisis of authority that lies at the heart of the faith. Evangelicals have never had a single authority to guide them through these dilemmas or settle the troublesome question of what the Bible actually means. Worthen chronicles the ideological warfare, institutional conflict, and clashes between modern gurus and maverick disciples that lurk behind the more familiar narrative of the rise of the Christian Right. The result is an ambitious intellectual history that weaves together stories from all corners of the evangelical world to explain the ideas and personalities-the scholarly ambitions and anti-intellectual impulses-that have made evangelicalism a cultural and political force.<br><br>In <em>Apostles of Reason</em>, Worthen recasts American evangelicalism as a movement defined not by shared doctrines or politics, but by the problem of reconciling head knowledge and heart religion in an increasingly secular America. She shows that understanding the rise of the Christian Right in purely political terms, as most scholars have done, misses the heart of the story. The culture wars of the late twentieth century emerged not only from the struggle between religious conservatives and secular liberals, but also from the civil war within evangelicalism itself-a battle over how to uphold the commands of both faith and reason, and how ultimately to lead the nation back onto the path of righteousness.<br></p><p><br><strong>Molly Worthen</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She is the author of <em>The Man on Whom Nothing Was Lost: The Grand Strategy of Charles Hill </em>and is a regular contributor to <em>The New York Times, Slate, Christianity Today</em>, and other publications.<br><br>"Mary Worthen s <em>Apostles of Reason: The Crisis of Authority in American Evangelicalism</em> is an accessible yet meticulously researched addition to our understanding of our religious history. It should be of great interest to scholars of religion and American culture."--<em>The Journal of American</em> <em>Culture</em><p></p><br>"Molly Worthen makes a significant and provocative contribution to the rich recent literature on American evangelicalism Worthen offers an impressive survey and analysis of modern American evangelicalism and the challenges that have confronted it."--<em>Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and</em> <em>Theology</em><p></p><br>"The author of this book has brought a sharp intelligence to the ongoing battle for control of evangelicalism. Her insights are as clear as her prose and her reporting is rigorous. An excellent book that ... tells (evangelical history) with vigor, depth and nuance. An excellent addition to any religion reporter's shelf." -Religion Newswriters' Association<p></p><br>"Particularly impressive is Worthen's ability to weave the story of American evangelicalism back into the narrative of mainstream American history and, perhaps more importantly, to make it appear to matter. Anyone interested in recent American history will profit from reading <em>Apostles of</em> <em>Reason</em>."--<em>Journal of Southern Religion</em><p></p><br>"Beautifully written and compellingly argued it should be required reading for anyone who wants to understand American evangelicalism or the broader religious tension between head and heart."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"[A] remarkable and textured study." --Randall Balmer, <em>The Christian Century</em> <br><p></p><br>"Worthen's a beguiling portraitist." --<em>Slate</em> <br><p></p><br>"Pathbreaking and gracefully narrated." --<em>The Nation</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Apostles of Reason</em> turns intellectual history into page-turning drama, highlighting the flesh-and-blood personalities behind academic debates... the most exciting history of evangelical intellectual life to appear in decades." --<em>Books &amp; Culture</em> <br><p></p><br>"Lively and story-filled...

Albert Mohler Jr., <em>The Gospel Coalition</em> <br><p></p><br>"Molly Worthen has written a truly important book. <em>Apostles of Reason: The Crisis of Authority in American Evangelicalism</em> is the kind of highly ambitious intellectual history that requires thorough familiarity with the sources, a keen eye for discerning intellectual undercurrents, a gift for telling a complicated, many faceted story, and, perhaps most importantly, an editorial aptitude for weaving it all together." --<em>National Catholic Reporter</em> <br><p></p><br>"[An] impressively wide-ranging account." --George M. Marsden, <em>Commonweal</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Apostles of Reason</em> brings a new level of sophistication, as well as sparkling prose, to the study of modern American evangelicals. A combination of empathetic understanding and critical acumen makes this an unusually humane, as well as unusually insightful, book." --Mark Noll, author of <em>America's</em> <em>God: From Jonathan Edwards to Abraham Lincoln</em> <br><p></p><br>"Molly Worthen's account of the evangelical imagination across the past seventy years is both sympathetic and critical. She captures the diversity of American evangelicals, their hopes and anxieties, and the nuances of their strategies for cultural influence." --Daniel Walker Howe, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848</em> <br><p></p><br>"Ambitious in its analytical breadth, at once incisive and playful in presentation, and utterly convincing, Molly Worthen's <em>Apostles of Reason</em> is first-rate in every sense. This is a path-breaking book about a quintessentially modern movement. Readers of all persuasions will welcome it." --Darren Dochuk, author of <em>From Bible Belt to Sunbelt</em> <br><p></p><br>"Molly Worthen's <em>Apostles of Reason</em> is an important contribution to the ongoing debate within evangelicalism about how to get along as a family of churches... Reading Worthen's account of evangelicalism is a breath of fresh air in many ways." --<em>First Things</em> <br><p></p><br>"This book's virtues are many. The prose alone-consistently clear and vigorous, and sparkling with memorable turns of phrase-is worth the price of admission... It is a singular accomplishment." --<em>Christian Century</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Apostles of Reason</em> represents a synthetic and interpretive triumph... It is difficult to overstate how witty her writing is, which is quite an accomplishment given how potentially dry a study of evangelical intellectualism could be. Moreover, Worthen grounds her sparkling prose in impeccable research." --David R. Swartz, Asbury University, <em>The Mennonite Quarterly Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"Worthen's telling of this narrative is gripping. It is difficult to overstate how witty her writing is, which is quite an acomplishment given how potentially dry a study of evangelical intellectualism could be. Moreover, Worthen grounds her sparkling prose in impeccable research." --<em>The Mennonite</em> <em>Quarterly Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"...Worthen's historical account of American evangelicalism over the past seven decades is fair, enlightening, and unsettling... I recommend the book highly especially to evangelicals who desire a cogent explanation of why evangelicalism still holds promise--theologically, socially, politically--even though it remains fractured movement." --<em>Religious Studies Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"Worthen offers an engaging road map through evangelical thought. Almost encyclopedic in nature, her book ably captures its richness and variety- and polarization as well."-- Justus Doenecke, <em>Anglican and Episcopal History</em> <br><p></p><br>"Worthen has written a volume that will permanently enrich the academy's understanding of American evangelicalism, offered up in a playful, humorous style that her readers will find approachable, if not entertaining. Any student of American religion will read it with profit."-- <em>Review &amp; Expositor</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Spandau: The Secret Diaries</h2><p>He served as Hitler's architect, the undisputed master of the German war machine, and the one responsible for conscripted foreign labor in the Third Reich. And, when Albert Speer was captured and sentenced at Nuremberg--after becoming the only defendant to plead guilty--he started keeping this secret diary, much of it on toilet paper. After 20 years of imprisonment, he found 25,000 of the smuggled pages waiting for him, and from those entries he shaped this deeply powerful document. "Albert Speer's book is a deeply moving document. It is also of extraordinary political and psychological interest...a must for anyone interested in psychological motivation of political action and the problem of guilt and repentance. But, beyond this it is so fascinatingly written that I could not put it down before I finished it." --<i>Erich Fromm</i>.<br></p><p>Albert Speer was unique in the Third Reich. An intellectual architect, he was befriended by Hitler in 1933 and for the next 12 years they maintained one of the most powerful and extraordinary relationships in the Nazi hierarchy. In 1942 Speer was appointed Armaments Minister and became second only to Hitler himself as a power on the home front. But in 1945, Speer defied Hitler&#39;s scorched earth policy and began to plan his assassination. At Nuremberg he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Minecraft Modding For Kids Fd (For Kids For Dummies)</h2><p><b>Join more than 100 million players in the online world of Minecraft</b><br><br>Are you a Minecraft fanatic looking to mod your games?

Increasingly, however, investigators are focusing on shame as a key aspect of human behavior. This volume captures a range of compelling viewpoints on the role of shame in psychological development, psychopathology, and the therapeutic process. Donald Nathanson has assembled internationally prominent authorities, engaging them in extensive dialogue about their areas of expertise. Concise introductions to each chapter place the authors both historically and theoretically, and outline their emphases and contributions to our understanding of shame. Including many illustrative clinical examples, the book covers such topics as the relationship between shame and narcissism, shame's central place in affect theory, psychosis and shame, and shame in the literature of French psychoanalysis and philosophy. <br></p><p>"Every decade or so in the world of psychiatry and psychology, a book appears that opens up and explores a burgeoning new field and stimulates its further development. THE MANY FACES OF SHAME can claim to perform this essential service, leaving clinicians like myself grateful for the contributions of this pioneer effort. It enlarges theoretical perspectives and also enhances clinical skills in ways that are now curiously neglected. It is my belief that many patients, needful of help, are lost to treatment because the shame factors inherent in this situation have been overlooked."--E. James Anthony, MD<br><br>"Rich, provocative, and timely, this landmark volume explores the neglected domain of shame.

Ditta M. Oliker shows us how to recognize and dismantle these systems now that they have outlived their usefulness and how to achieve personal fulfillment in the present.</p><br><p><b>Ditta M. Oliker, PhD</b>, is a founding member of Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum. Her PhD in clinical psychology is from CSPP, Los Angeles, and she has been in private practice for more than thirty years. She is a frequent lecturer at universities and mental health facilities.</p><br></p><p>Ditta M. Oliker: Ditta M. Oliker, PhD started her career in theater at the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA had recently formed a partnership with members of the film industry to establish a professional theater on campus known as The Theater Group. The organization evolved into the Mark Taper Forum at the Los Angeles Music Center, with Oliker as a member of the core producing staff. <br>After a personal tragedy, she went back to school and graduated with a Ph.D. in clinical psychology. Dr. Oliker has been in private practice in Los Angeles for over 30 years. She began to develop her ideas about psychological survival while in graduate school and realized the effectiveness of the survival system concept soon after beginning her practice. She has lectured on the subject at various universities and mental health facilities, including UCLA and Alliant University, among others. Most recently, she taught an innovative program on Staying in the Moment using improvisational theater techniques. <br>Her innovative approach to the field of psychotherapy is based on her knowledge of psychodynamic theory interwoven with her theater background. Her concept of survival systems is based, not only on theory, but also on her understanding of the struggles of her patients; on her own life history; and on her work in the theater which showed her the power of creative communication. <br>For information about seminars, presentations, or professional consultations, go to www.dittaolikerphd.com <br></p><h2>Law&#39;s Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters.</h2><p><p>What does economics have to do with law? Suppose legislators propose that armed robbers receive life imprisonment. Editorial pages applaud them for getting tough on crime. Constitutional lawyers raise the issue of cruel and unusual punishment. Legal philosophers ponder questions of justness. An economist, on the other hand, observes that making the punishment for armed robbery the same as that for murder encourages muggers to kill their victims. This is the cut-to-the-chase quality that makes economics not only applicable to the interpretation of law, but beneficial to its crafting.</p><br><p> Drawing on numerous commonsense examples, in addition to his extensive knowledge of Chicago-school economics, David D. Friedman offers a spirited defense of the economic view of law. He clarifies the relationship between law and economics in clear prose that is friendly to students, lawyers, and lay readers without sacrificing the intellectual heft of the ideas presented. Friedman is the ideal spokesman for an approach to law that is controversial not because it overturns the conclusions of traditional legal scholars--it can be used to advocate a surprising variety of political positions, including both sides of such contentious issues as capital punishment--but rather because it alters the very nature of their arguments. For example, rather than viewing landlord-tenant law as a matter of favoring landlords over tenants or tenants over landlords, an economic analysis makes clear that a bad law injures both groups in the long run. And unlike traditional legal doctrines, economics offers a unified approach, one that applies the same fundamental ideas to understand and evaluate legal rules in contract, property, crime, tort, and every other category of law, whether in modern day America or other times and places--and systems of non-legal rules, such as social norms, as well.</p><br><p> This book will undoubtedly raise the discourse on the increasingly important topic of the economics of law, giving both supporters and critics of the economic perspective a place to organize their ideas.</p></p><p><p>"David Friedman, a first-rate economist with a good deal of experience in applying economics to the law, has written a lucid, imaginative, entertaining, opinionated, and, on balance, a very fine introduction to the application of economics to law. The book is wide-ranging in scope, at once simple and highly sophisticated, consistently provocative, an excellent read, and a notable contribution to an exciting field of interdisciplinary studies."<b>--Richard A. Posner, Chief Judge, United States Court of Appeals For the Seventh Circuit</b></p><p>"David Friedman explains in clear and accessible language what basic economic theory adds to the understanding of law, and how simple concepts of rationality, value, and transaction costs can go a long way to bring out the hidden unity among various diverse branches of law. Whether one speaks of the complexities of marginal deterrence, the resolution of disputes between farmers and railroads, or the social functions of copyright and patent law, Friedman's book provides the outsider to the field with a comprehensive but accessible account of his legal subject matter."<b>--Richard A.

It was the best-selling novel of the 19th century (and the second best-selling book of the century after the Bible) and is credited with helping to fuel the abolitionist cause in the United States prior to the American Civil War. When Stowe met Abraham Lincoln in 1862 (during the Civil War), he reportedly greeted her with, &#34;So you&#39;re the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war!&#34;</p><p><p>Harriet Beecher Stowe was an American author and abolitionist. Born in Litchfield, Connecticut, she was raised in a deeply religious family and educated in a seminary school run by her elder sister. In her adult life, Stowe married biblical scholar and abolitionist Calvin Ellis Stowe, who would later go on to work as Harriet s literary agent, and the two participated in the Underground Railroad by providing temporary refuge for escaped slaves travelling to the American North. Shortly before the outbreak of the American Civil War, Stowe published her most famous work, Uncle Tom s Cabin, a stark and sympathetic depiction of the desperate lives of African American slaves. The book went on to see unprecedented sales, and informed American and European attitudes towards abolition. In the years leading up to her death, suffering from dementia or Alzheimer s disease, Stowe is said to have begun re-writing Uncle Tom s Cabin, almost word-for-word, believing that she was writing the original manuscript once again. Stowe died in July 1, 1896 at the age of eighty-five.</p></p><h2>Modernism and Music: An Anthology of Sources</h2><p>If in earlier eras music may have seemed slow to respond to advances in other artistic media, during the modernist age it asserted itself in the vanguard. <i>Modernism and Music</i> provides a rich selection of texts on this moment, some translated into English for the first time. It offers not only important statements by composers and critics, but also musical speculations by poets, novelists, philosophers, and others-all of which combine with Daniel Albright's extensive, interlinked commentary to place modernist music in the full context of intellectual and cultural history.</p><p><b>Daniel Albright </b>is a professor of English and American Literature at Harvard University. He is the author of <i>Untwisting the Serpent: Modernism in Music</i>, <i>Literature, and Other Arts</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press."I highly recommend Daniel Albright's collection as a useful set of texts for any course dealing with Modernism, especially Modernism in music. In no other place are so many important writings gathered together, and students will find the introductory and explanatory material extremely helpful when beginning their studies." (Alan Shockley <i>Fontes Artis Musicae</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Modernism and Music</i>, Albright assigns the full flush of Modernism to the period 1890&#x2013;1910, identifying 1894 as a watershed year in the history of music (Debussy&#x2019;s <i>Pr�lude � l&#x2019;apr�s-midi d&#x2019;un faune,</i> Strauss&#x2019;s <i>Till Eulenspiegel).</i> He is, however, perfectly justified in including earlier, hugely influential works such as Nietzsche&#x2019;s <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i> (1872), Wagner&#x2019;s <i>Beethoven</i> (1870), and Baudelaire&#x2019;s <i>Les fleurs du mal</i> (1857) in his scope. . . .

It also sheds light on the forms and functions of memory as victims relive devastating experiences of pain, humiliation, and loss. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Drawing on the Fortunoff Video Archives for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, Lawrence L. Langer shows how oral Holocaust testimonies complement historical studies by enabling us to confront the human dimensions of the catastrophe. Quoting extensively from these interviews, Langer develops a technique for interpreting them as we might a written text. He contrasts written and oral narratives, noting that while survivor memoirs by authors such as Primo Levi and Charlotte Delbo transform reality through style, imagery, chronology, or a coherent moral vision, oral testimonies resist these organizing impulses and allow instead a kind of unshielded truth to emerge, just as powerful in its impact as the visions taking shape in written memoirs. He argues that it is necessary to deromanticize the survival experience and that to burden it with accolades about the &#x201c;indomitable human spirit&#x201d; is to slight its painful complexity and ambivalence. Finally he explores the perplexing task of establishing a meaningful connection between consequential living and inconsequential dying, between moral striving and the sprit of anguish and sense of a diminished self that pervades these haunting Holocaust testimonies. </p></p><p>Disturbing and controversial, this work is based on 300 of the more than 1,400 taped interviews with Holocaust survivors preserved at Yale University's Fortunoff Video Archives. It's disturbing because of the survivors' graphic retelling of the starvation, torture, brutalization and cannibalism that occurred in the Nazi death camps. It's controversial because, instead of focusing on the bravery necessary to endure such horrors, Langer's book delves into the psychic wounds that 50 years after their infliction remain unhealed. "We have these double lives," said one survivor. "We can't cancel out. It just won't go away." <b>Holocaust Memories</b> won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism for 1991.Hundreds of videotaped oral testimonies by Holocaust survivors are preserved in the Fortunoff Video Archives at Yale University. These tapes comprise a spontaneous record of victims' unimaginable ordeals, their disorientation, subsequent readjustment and the psychic scars they still carry. Intermingling their narratives with a structural analysis that draws on the writings of Primo Levi, Maurice Blanchot, Viktor Frankl, Martin Gilbert and others, Langer ( The Holocaust and the Literary Imagination ) explores how survivors created an "impromptu self," following impulses in order to stay alive. He notes that for many, the Nazi assault on body and spirit resulted in a permanent sense of discontinuity with normal assumptions about good and evil, individual choice and responsibility. This brilliant, scholarly book stares into the void; it eschews tributes to heroism and martyrdom, focusing instead on the personal and societal wreckage caused by mass murder.

In place of the land of pizza, sunshine, and soccer, McCarthy describes a developing nation: an economy that has found its own road to success via the <em>piccole imprese</em> with an increasingly strong stockmarket and more sophisticated banking; a dynamic, traditional, family-centered society; and a political system struggling to modernize after forty years of Christian Democrat rule and Communist opposition. McCarthy also looks at the role of the Church, including Pius XII's wartime activities and the 'foreign pope', John-Paul II before finally turning to sport in Italy - the only country to have 3 daily newspapers devoted to the subject. <br> <br> Authoritative, accessible, and absorbing, the book examines modern Italy through the eyes of 10 leading commentators and explores the Italian experience in the wider context of both the nation's past and its wider contemporary European position.<br></p><p><br><strong>Patrick McCarthy</strong> is Professor of European Studies at John Hopkins University, Bologna.<br>Italy Since 1945 represents the final volume in the excellent &#39;Short Oxford History of Italy Series.

Wax is tactile, ambiguous, and mesmerizing, confounding viewers and scholars alike.

Volume 1 provides a thorough introduction to the bosonic string, based on the Polyakov path integral and conformal field theory. The first four chapters introduce the central ideas of string theory, the tools of conformal field theory, the Polyakov path integral, and the covariant quantization of the string. The book then treats string interactions: the general formalism, and detailed treatments of the tree level and one loop amplitudes. Toroidal compactification and many important aspects of string physics, such as T-duality and D-branes are also covered, as are higher-order amplitudes, including an analysis of their finiteness and unitarity, and various nonperturbative ideas. The volume closes with an appendix giving a short course on path integral methods, followed by annotated references, and a detailed glossary.</p><p>String theory has advanced rapidly over the last 15 years and is increasingly seen as the best, and perhaps only, route to the complete unification of the four fundamental forces--the so-called &#34;theory of everything&#34;. This text provides, in two volumes, a thoroughly modern and comprehensive introduction to strings and superstrings, and brings the reader up to date on the latest developments in string duality, M-theory, D-branes, and the application of string theory to black hole quantum mechanics. The author is one of the world&#39;s top string theorists, and is also known as a clear and cogent writer. The two volumes are written at a level appropriate to graduate students in physics. This is the first major textbook on strings since the two volume work of Green, Schwartz and Witten 10 years ago (which sold extraordinarily well, reprinting within a month of publication). The main market for the book is theoretical physicists, particle physicists, astrophysicists, cosmologists and applied mathematicians. However, this is an accessible book on one of the most fundamental questions in physics by a top researcher. It has all the ingredients to be a best seller."...the most comprehensive text addressing the discoveries of the superstring revolutions of the early to mid 1990's, which mark the beginnings of 'modern' string theory." <br>Donald Marolf, University of California Santa Barbara, American Journal of Physics<br><br>"Physicists believe that the best hope for a fundamental theory of nature--including unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity and elementary particle theory--lies in string theory.

Fuller's creations often bordered on the realm of science fiction, ranging from the freestanding geodesic dome to the three-wheel Dymaxion car to a bathroom requiring neither plumbing nor sewage. Yet in spite of his brilliant mind and life-long devotion to serving mankind, Fuller's expansive ideas were often dismissed, and have faded from public memory since his death. <br><br><em>You Belong to the Universe</em> documents Fuller's six-decade quest to "make the world work for one hundred percent of humanity." Critic and experimental philosopher Jonathon Keats sets out to revive Fuller's unconventional practice of comprehensive anticipatory design, placing Fuller's philosophy in a modern context and dispelling much of the mythology surrounding Fuller's life. Keats argues that Fuller's life and ideas, namely doing "the most with the least," are now more relevant than ever as humanity struggles to meet the demands of an exploding world population with finite resources. Delving deeply into Buckminster Fuller's colorful world, Keats applies Fuller's most important concepts to present-day issues, arguing that his ideas are now not only feasible, but necessary. <br><br>From transportation to climate change, urban design to education,<em> You Belong to the Univers</em>e demonstrates that Fuller's holistic problem-solving techniques may be the only means of addressing some of the world's most pressing issues. Keats's timely book challenges each of us to become comprehensive anticipatory design scientists, providing the necessary tools for continuing Fuller's legacy of improving the world.<br></p><p><br>Jonathon Keats is a writer, artist and experimental philosopher. He is recently the author of the story collection <em>The Book of the Unknown</em> (Random House), winner of the American Library Association's 2010 Sophie Brody Medal, as well as<em> Virtual Words: Language on the Edge of Science and Technology</em> (2010) and <em>Forged: Why Fakes are the Great Art of Our Age</em> (2013), both published by OUP.<br><br>"A wonderfully written and highly necessary book about one of the 20th century's most enigmatic outliers." -- Douglas Coupland, author and artist <br><p></p><br>"Brilliantly challenging Buckminster Fuller's self-mythologizing by putting Fuller's life and ideas in their historical context, Jonathon Keats is all the more able to identify the ways of thinking that were truly original in Fuller's own time, and the concepts that can address today's environmental and technological dilemmas. Keats's sympathetic but firm critique of Fuller, and his own suggestions for the human future, make this book a must for Fuller enthusiasts and skeptics alike - in fact, for everyone aspiring to think outside the dome." -- Edward Tenner, author of <em>Why Things Bite Back</em> and <em>Our Own Devices</em> <br><p></p><br>"Jonathon Keats audaciously tackles the grandiose Buckminster Fuller, debunking Fuller's legend while extending his inventive thinking for our present day.

Buckminster Fuller was born in privilege, educated by experience and his own intuition, and created his own myth. Along the way he enriched human existence with inventions such as the geodesic dome and revolutionary concepts about peace and our place in the environment.

The work of a remarkable man has yielded a remarkable book." -- Michael Hiltzik, author of <em>Big Science</em> <br><p></p><br>"Keats' excellent book on Buckminster Fuller recalls a remarkable life in engineering and beyond, an underestimated and underappreciated life.

What they'll get as well though is a primer in a way of thinking about innovation that warrants a revival." -<em>Engineering &amp; Technology Magazine</em> <br><p></p><br>"[Keats's] even-handed treatment of Fuller's failures and successes enables him to tease out their lessons. One can read Keats's book as a thought experiment about how the future might be designed." -<em>The Los Angeles Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"[Keats] makes a tremendous case for why the eccentric ideas of the erstwhile visionary matter today. With admirable concision and a prose style as delightful as it is rigorous, Keats critically examines six of Fuller's most important ideas, ending each section with a 'proposition' of his own that builds on-and often goes far beyond-his predecessor's original. In what becomes a kind of collaboration between two like minds separated by a century, Fuller's soaring mission to 'make the world work for one hundred percent of humanity' is given new-and newly plausible-life." -<em>Brooklyn Rail</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Alfred Stieglitz At Lake George</h2><p>For more than a decade before World War I, Alfred Stieglitz lent much of his formidable energy to his public career as an editor, publisher, proselytizer, and art dealer. In the 1920s and 30s, he turned again to his own photography, exploring his personal world at Lake George, in the Adirondack mountains of New York, where he spent summers at a family farmhouse. He photographed the things around him--the landscape, the clouds overhead, the intimate life he led with family and friends, including Georgia O&#39;Keefe, Waldo Frank, and Paul Rosenfeld. This body of work, radical and private, is the essential aspect of Stieglitz&#39;s achievement as a photographer, and has nowhere else been published as a coherent whole.</p><p>Perhaps no other person has done as much to legitimize the art of photography as did Alfred Stieglitz. Born in 1864 in Hoboken, New Jersey, Stieglitz studied mechanical engineering in Berlin but was always drawn to taking pictures. He won the first of his 150 photography prizes at age 24 in a British competition judged by P.H. Emerson. Returning to New York in 1889, Stieglitz began writing on photography and exhibiting his own work, the most celebrated of which include <i>The Terminal</i> (1893) and <i>The Steerage</i> (1907). In 1902, Stieglitz founded the Photo-Secession group and opened his first gallery, 291, where he exhibited American photographers of the Pictorialist movement, and painters and sculptors including Matisse, Braque, Rodin, and Georgia O'Keeffe, whom he married in 1924.

A great help if you seem to guess right half the time or less when playing the dummy.</p><p>Mike Lawrence is concerned less with how to play your hand than with how to <i>think</i> about playing. The idea is to minimize risk by deducing where your opponent's high cards are. Lawrence shows how to spot and interpret clues from the opening bid on with chapters titled "Sizing Up the Case," "Finding the Witness," "Analyzing the Clues," "Conducting the Investigation," "Checking the Evidence," "Nailing Down the Case," and "Making Your Sixth Sense Work." The latter deals with watching your opponent's body language for the "tells" that reveal their thoughts involuntarily. Each chapter but the last features a quiz section to help you practice techniques.</p><h2>Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics)</h2><p><i>The Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson</i>, by <b>Emily Dickinson</b>, is part of the <i><i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

However, in her mid-twenties she began to grow reclusive, and eventually she rarely descended from her room in her father&#x2019;s house. She spent most of her time working on her poetry, largely without encouragement or real interest from her family and peers, and died at age fifty-five. Only a handful of her 1,775 poems had been published during her lifetime. When her poems finally appeared after her death, readers immediately recognized an artist whose immense depth and stylistic complexities would one day make her the most widely recognized female poet to write in the English language.<p>Dickinson&#x2019;s poetry is remarkable for its tightly controlled emotional and intellectual energy. The longest poem covers less than two pages. Yet in theme and tone her writing reaches for the sublime as it charts the landscape of the human soul. A true innovator, Dickinson experimented freely with conventional rhythm and meter, and often used dashes, off rhymes, and unusual metaphors techniques that strongly influenced modern poetry. Dickinson&#x2019;s idiosyncratic style, along with her deep resonance of thought and her observations about life and death, love and nature, and solitude and society, have firmly established her as one of America&#x2019;s true poetic geniuses.</p><p><b>Includes an index of first lines.</b><br></p></p><p>Emily Dickinson was a prolific writer and yet, with the exception of four poems in a limited regional volume, her poems were never published during her lifetime. It was indeed fortunate that her sister discovered the poems&#x2014;all loosely bound in bundles&#x2014;shortly after Dickinson died. <br><i>Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson</i> is the complete collection of the first three volumes of poetry published posthumously in 1890, 1891, and 1896 by editors Mary Loomis Todd and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. The volumes were all received with high acclaim and contain some of her best-known poems. It was in the twentieth century, however, that Dickinson was finally recognized as one of the great poets and, without dispute, the most popular. <br>The name Emily Dickinson is a legend now, but she never had the opportunity to taste the wine of success and fame in her lifetime. In fact, if there was any legendary status she received in her life, it was not for poetry but for the way she lived her life. She received local notoriety in her native town of Amherst, Massachusetts, as an eccentric recluse who, with few exceptions, would never set foot outside her house. Yet, as her poetry will attest, she had a keen insight of life, love, nature, and death and seemed to be content with her station in life.<br>Reading through the poems in <i>Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson</i>, you will see that she was indeed a woman of independence and spirit, a poet that lives today in our hearts and minds.<p><b>From Rachel Wetzsteon&#x2019;s introduction to <i>The Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson</i></b></p><p>Emily Dickinson, writing to the editor Thomas Wentworth Higginson in July 1862, reported that she had no portrait,&#x201d; but offered the following description in place of one: Small, like the Wren, and my Hair is bold, like the Chestnut Bur and my eyes, like the Sherry in the Glass, that the Guest leaves Would this do just as well?&#x201d; (<i>Selected Letters</i>, edited by Thomas H. Johnson, p. 175; see For Further Reading&#x201d;). Despite Dickinson&#x2019;s claim, we do possess one photograph of her a daguerreotype taken in 1847 or 1848, when she was in her late teens. The image certainly confirms her self-portrait: Her frame is tiny; her shiny hair does indeed sit boldly atop her head; and her dark eyes really do glisten like liquor at the bottom of a glass.</p><p>The photograph also suggests many of the rich puzzles and paradoxes that have informed our view of Dickinson since the last decade of the nineteenth century, when readers and critics began to read, study, and obsess over her poems. Dickinson&#x2019;s body, with its delicate hands and slender torso, may resemble the fragile form of someone too weak to venture far from home; but her huge moist eyes stare at us with the wisdom, depth, and longing of a woman who has traveled around the world and come back with stories, not all of them fit for mixed company. She demurely clutches a bouquet of flowers, and a book rests primly at her side; but her full, sensuous lips reveal a person whose thoughts may not always tend toward such tidy subjects as flowers and books. We look away from the photograph intrigued and stirred: What&#x2019;s going on in her mind? How could this slight figure be the author of some of the most passionate love poems, the most searing descriptions of loss, the most haunting religious lyrics ever written?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, on December 10, 1830, the middle child of Edward and Emily Norcross Dickinson; her brother, Austin, was born in 1829 and her sister, Lavinia, in 1833. Her father, a lawyer, served as treasurer of Amherst College (her grandfather was a co-founder of the college), and also occupied important positions on the General Court of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts State Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. His Heart,&#x201d; Dickinson wrote in a letter, was pure and terrible and I think no other like it exists&#x201d; (<i>Letters</i>, p. 223). He was strictly religious (something she would later rebel against), leading the family prayers every day and often censoring her reading; but he also ensured that Dickinson grew up in a household surrounded by books and heated intellectual debates. Her mother was a more shadowy presence; Dickinson wrote that she does not care for thought&#x201d; (<i>Letters</i>, p. 173);<b> </b>more harshly, she claimed, I never had a mother. I suppose a mother is one to whom you hurry when you are troubled&#x201d; (<i>Letters</i>, vol. 2, p. 475).<b> </b>Even so, the Dickinsons remained an extremely close-knit family; after her brother, Austin, married, he and his wife settled right next door.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dickinson attended the coeducational Amherst Academy from the ages of ten to seventeen, and then went on to the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (now Mount Holyoke College) in nearby South Hadley. She blossomed there into a social and spirited young woman. The most significant event of her stay occurred at a fundamentalist Calvinist revival meeting, when she was asked to stand and declare herself a Christian and refused. After one year at Mount Holyoke she returned in 1948 to Amherst, where she remained, apart from brief trips to Boston, Cambridge, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., for the rest of her life.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At school and at home, Dickinson received an excellent education. At the Amherst Academy alone she studied the arts, English literature, rhetoric, philosophy, Latin, French, German, history, geography, classics, and the Bible; she also received a firm grounding in the sciences, mathematics, geology, botany, natural history, physiology, and astronomy. At home the Dickinsons&#x2019; large and varied library included books by Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau, Longfellow, Shakespeare, Keats, the Brownings, the Bront�s, and George Eliot, along with Noah Webster&#x2019;s <i>An American Dictionary of the English Language</i> which for Dickinson would prove one of the most important books of all and a healthy dose of newspapers and romance novels.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During her early twenties, Dickinson began to dress in white, to leave her house only on rare occasions, and to restrict the circle of her acquaintances until it numbered just a few people. Often speaking to visitors through a screen or from an adjoining room, she soon developed a reputation as a town eccentric. The young Mabel Loomis Todd, having recently moved to Amherst with her husband, David, remarked in a letter to her parents about a strange resident:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I must tell you about the <i>character</i> of Amherst. It is a lady whom all the people call the <i>Myth</i>. She is a sister of Mr. Dickinson, &amp; seems to be the climax of all the family oddity. She has not been outside her house in fifteen years, except once to see a new church, when she crept out at night, &amp; viewed it by moonlight. No one who calls upon her mother &amp; sister ever sees her, but she allows little children once in a great while, &amp; one at a time, to come in, when she gives them cake or candy, or some nicety, for she is very fond of little ones. But more often she lets down the sweetmeat by a string, out of a window, to them. She dresses wholly in white, &amp; her mind is said to be perfectly wonderful. She writes finely, but no one <i>ever</i> sees her. Her sister . . . invited me to come &amp; sing to her mother sometime. . . . People tell me the <i>myth</i> will hear every note she will be near, but unseen. . . . Isn&#x2019;t that like a book? So interesting (Farr, <i>Emily Dickinson: A Collection of Critical Essays</i>, p. 20).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One can hardly blame Todd for being fascinated by such an unusual character.&#x201d; But unfortunately, the myth&#x201d; she takes such pleasure in describing influenced our later notions of Dickinson much too heavily. Despite her seclusion, a large number of prominent figures came and went through her house. She also developed deep, though largely epistolary, friendships with several people: the clergyman Charles Wadsworth, whom she met in Philadelphia and described as her dearest earthly friend&#x201d;; Samuel Bowles, editor of the Springfield <i>Republican</i>; and Judge Otis Phillips Lord of Salem, Massachusetts.</p></p><h2>Russian �migr� Short Stories from Bunin to Yanovsky</h2><p><b>A landmark anthology that will introduce many extraordinary, unknown Russian writers to an English-language readership for the first time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></b><br> Fleeing Russia amid the chaos of the Russian Revolution and subsequent Civil War, many writers went on to settle in Paris, Berlin and elsewhere and forged new lives in exile. Much of their subsequent work, published in Russian language magazines and books, is entirely unknown in the West and has only been recently discovered in Russia itself. As well as including stories by the most famous �migr� writers, Vladimir Nabokov and Ivan Bunin, this collection introduces many lesser known voices: Yuri Felzen, known as "the Russian Proust", Nadezhda Teffi, the hugely popular and funny story writer, and Georgy Ivanov, whose work of poetic prose "The Atom Explodes" is a brilliant, haunting response to the upheaval and trauma of emigration. Exploring themes of displacement, nostalgia, loss and new beginnings, this anthology will transform the Anglophone world's understanding of Russian �migr� writing in the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Bryan Karetnyk</b> is an editor and a translator of Russian literature.

The Roman Market Economy uses the tools of modern economics to show how trade, markets, and the Pax Romana were critical to ancient Rome's prosperity.Peter Temin, one of the world's foremost economic historians, argues that markets dominated the Roman economy. He traces how the Pax Romana encouraged trade around the Mediterranean, and how Roman law promoted commerce and banking. Temin shows that a reasonably vibrant market for wheat extended throughout the empire, and suggests that the Antonine Plague may have been responsible for turning the stable prices of the early empire into the persistent inflation of the late. He vividly describes how various markets operated in Roman times, from commodities and slaves to the buying and selling of land. Applying modern methods for evaluating economic growth to data culled from historical sources, Temin argues that Roman Italy in the second century was as prosperous as the Dutch Republic in its golden age of the seventeenth century.The Roman Market Economy reveals how economics can help us understand how the Roman Empire could have ruled seventy million people and endured for centuries.<br></p><p><p>"The study of ancient economies has for many generations been a fiercely debated field. Peter Temin has produced a book that will in many ways foster renewed energy in this great debate. What is of special value here is his economic analysis, including the use of regressions to show that price movements in the Roman provinces must be linked to those in Rome itself, and that the Roman economy, therefore, was a market economy. Whether one agrees or not with this basic conclusion, the framing of the evidence will alter the terms of the debate, and not just for the Roman economy but for Hellenistic economies as well. The book is a must-read for all economic historians and will surely become one of the most widely read books on the ancient economy."<b>--J. G. Manning, Yale University</b></p><p>"Peter Temin's fascinating book deploys the techniques of economic analysis to understand the nature of Roman trade, markets, and transactions, and definitively challenges the view of the Roman Empire as a 'primitive' economy. Stressing the importance of markets, trade, commerce, and banking, and emphasizing their prominence in the evidence from ancient texts and archaeology, Temin offers a sophisticated account of Rome's economic institutions and practices that fundamentally revises and enriches our understanding of the prosperity and the decline of this major imperial power."<b>--Alan K. Bowman, University of Oxford</b></p><p>"This is a very important book, and I know of no other quite like it. Temin's scholarship promotes and illustrates the relevance of economic theory to the study of Roman history. <i>The Roman Market Economy</i> contains plenty of claims that are controversial, but that's what will energize the debate."<b>--Walter Scheidel, coeditor of <i>The Oxford Handbook of Roman Studies</i></b></p><p>"Economic historians have actively studied medieval and early modern Europe for decades, but few have ventured back as far as Peter Temin does here. He demonstrates that economic arguments apply just as well to the ancient world, and that even quite general propositions can be tested against evidence from antiquity."<b>--Fran�ois R.

Watson had the authority, flair, and courage to take an early and prominent role as commentator on the march of DNA science and its implications for society. In essays for publications large and small, and in lectures around the world, he delivered what were, in effect, dispatches from the front lines of the revolution. Outspoken and sparkling with ideas and opinions, a selection of them is collected for the first time in this volume. Their resonance with today&#39;s headlines is striking.</p><p>Crick and Watson&#39;s discovery (in Cambridge) of the double helix structure of DNA was announced in 1953, when Watson was 25. Watson left Cambridge for Harvard where he spent many productive years as a professor. He became director of the decaying Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island and converted it in the space of a few years into one of the world&#39;s pre-eminent centres of molecular genetics and cancer research. He was one of the prime movers who brought into being the human genome project. Watson retired as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory a few years ago and is now its president.In A Passion for DNA: Genes, Genomes, and Society, James Watson once again proves that he is the "prose laureate" of biomedical sciences. As a result of his classic works, The Double Helix (1968) and Molecular Biology of the Gene (1965), we have come to expect him to treat complex issues with clarity and focus. Molecular Biology of the Gene may be a gold standard for judging modern textbooks, because it presents not only the experimental basis of molecular biology but also the principles of this field. <p> Given Watson's larger-than-life dimensions, it is necessary to avoid the temptation to review the man and not his book. In A Passion for DNA, a collection of essays written for a variety of occasions during the past three decades, he concentrates on three themes: his autobiography; the growth, practice, and application of molecular biology; and the contemporary ethos of science. Watson describes his growth and maturation as a scientist and administrator; the meaning of success in science; science and public policy; the nature of cancer research; the past, present, and future of DNA; and the Human Genome Project and its bioethical problems. It would have added to the value of the book if each essay had been preceded by an introduction by Watson describing the circumstances in which the essay was written and the rationale for its inclusion in this book. </p><p> Watson's recipes for success are basically as follows: success tends to beget success, and therefore you should learn from winners by associating yourself with the very talented; take risks, but be sure to have a fallback; and have fun and stay connected. Over and over again, the reader learns about the value of mentorship, scientific patronage, and luck (which Watson argues, as did Pasteur, "favors the prepared"). In recounting the contributions of the Watson laboratory to the growth of molecular biology after The Double Helix (or "What have you done lately?"), the author describes his seminal contributions to our knowledge of the structure of ribosomes, messenger RNA, protein synthesis, and the regulation of genetic expression. Only in passing does he note that after 1962, few papers from his laboratory bore his name rather than only the names of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who did the work. This actually represents an incredible act of generosity rarely, if ever, seen in today's competitive, publish-or-perish academic world. </p><p> Watson recalls the angst of the scientific community when it confronted the question of the safety and ethics of working with recombinant DNA and the resolve of the scientists at the Asilomar meeting in 1975 to declare a moratorium on this research until guidelines could be established. Watson is certainly correct in his assessment, based on today's record, that this moratorium was probably a waste of time and a needless blow to the momentum of science. However, he discounts the important message about the social responsibility of scientists that this voluntary moratorium transmitted to the public. </p><p> In an essay on cancer research and the "war on cancer," Watson tells us that to win wars one must know the enemy and the location of the battlefield. When Richard Nixon declared a war on cancer, this information was not yet available. The discovery and elucidation of the action of oncogenes and of cancer viruses were pivotal for understanding the terrain, planning the strategy, and pursuing the war. Watson provides numerous examples to stress the necessity of research in the basic sciences for developing successful therapies against cancer. </p><p> When addressing the problems of the "post-genomic age," "Honest Jim" (as he referred to himself in the working title of his autobiography, The Double Helix) is quick to point out the shameful story of eugenics in the United States, particularly at his own institution, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and in Germany. He suggests that whereas we in the United States have learned the lessons taught by the brutality and moral corruption of eugenics, Germany still has a way to go in accepting and acknowledging its past. In Watson's view, the spirit and path of science must be guided by the safeguards of investigation and discussion: we must now consider the ethical problems that will arise from the success of the Human Genome Project. </p><p> <i>Donald A.

Most contemporary scholars say no. In this challenge to prevailing views, Robert J. Richards says yes--and argues that current perspectives on Darwin and his theory are both ideologically motivated and scientifically unsound.<br><br>This provocative new reading of Darwin goes directly to the origins of evolutionary theory. Unlike most contemporary biologists or historians and philosophers of science, Richards holds that Darwin did concern himself with the idea of progress, or telos, as he constructed his theory. Richards maintains that Darwin drew on the traditional embryological meanings of the terms "evolution" and "descent with modification." In the 1600s and 1700s, "evolution" referred to the embryological theory of preformation, the idea that the embryo exists as a miniature adult of its own species that simply grows, or evolves, during gestation. By the early 1800s, however, the idea of preformation had become the concept of evolutionary recapitulation, the idea that during its development an embryo passes through a series of stages, each the adult form of an ancestor species.<br><br>Richards demonstrates that, for Darwin, embryological recapitulation provided a graphic model of how species evolve. If an embryo could be seen as successively taking the structures and forms of its ancestral species, then one could see the evolution of life itself as a succession of species, each transformed from its ancestor. Richards works with the <i>Origin</i> and other published and archival material to show that these embryological models were much on Darwin's mind as he considered the evidence for descent with modification.<br><br>Why do so many modern researchers find these embryological roots of Darwin's theory so problematic? Richards argues that the current tendency to see evolution as a process that is not progressive and not teleological imposes perspectives on Darwin that incorrectly deny the clearly progressive heart of his embryological models and his evolutionary theory.<br></p><p>RICHARDS, R.

He was raised by Virginia Prentiss, a former slave, before rejoining his mother and her new husband, John London. Largely self-educated, the teenage Jack made money stealing oysters and working on a schooner before briefly studying at the University of Berkeley in 1896. He left to join the Klondike Gold Rush a year later, a phenomenon that would go on to form the background of his literary masterpieces, <i>The Call of the Wild </i>(1903) and <i>White Fang </i>(1906). Alongside his novel writing, London dabbled in war reportage, agriculture and politics. He was married twice and had two daughters from his first marriage.

What are the true roots of these influences, however, and how do our interpretations of these aspects of the classics differ from their original reality? This introduction to the classics begins with a visit to the British Museum to view the frieze which once decorated the Apollo Temple a Bassae. Through these sculptures John Henderson and Mary Beard prompt us to consider the significance of the study of Classics as a means of discovery and enquiry, its value in terms of literature, philosophy, and culture, its source of imagery, and the reasons for the continuation of these images into and beyond the twentieth century. Designed for the general reader and student alike, <em>A Very Short Introduction to Classics</em> challenges readers to adopt a fresh approach to the Classics as a major cultural influence, both in the ancient world and twentieth-century--emphasizing the continuing need to understand and investigate this enduring subject.</p><p><br><em>About the Authors:</em><br> <strong>John Henderson</strong> is a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge. <strong>Mary Beard</strong> is a Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge.<br>This production is very short, but it deals more with our relationship with classics than with the classics themselves. Tim Bentinck's narration is lively without being showy, as befits a book of popular scholarship. He reads in a pleasant British accent and gets to show off only rarely, such as putting on a decent American accent for quotes from Jefferson. His German is also good. This is the underappreciated kind of reading that sounds straightforward and ordinary but requires practice and skill. The material is interesting when substantive, less so when theoretical, but Bentinck carries it all off well.

Dr. Backus passed away in June 2005.<b>Dr. William Backus</b> offers practical help and training to those who want to learn effective and loving interpersonal communication. "It seemed to me," Backus said, "that many people were talking to one another without much concern for the truth and love in what they were saying, and thus weakening the power of communication in the home, the Church, and other communities. <p></p> <p>He received a B.A. and a Bachelor of Divinity degree at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri.

Featuring twenty-four new readings, this incisive text addresses the broad range of subjects typically covered in a criminology course, including society's attempts to control crime and criminal behavior. <br><br>To help students understand the relevance and real-world applications of criminology, new coeditor J. Mitchell Miller has shaped this edition with new selections that address how criminological research directly influences practical responses to crime. Building on the work of coeditors Frank R. Scarpitti and Amie L. Nielsen, these cutting-edge readings reflect exciting developments in contemporary criminology while also preserving the text's original purpose: to compile a set of readings that represent both the breadth and variety of research on the causes of crime, its control, and related social policy issues. <br><br>In addition, this engaging text integrates many helpful pedagogical resources, which draw students into the core concepts and fundamental theories of the field:<br><br>* An introductory chapter begins each section, providing a survey of the major issues in each area and a helpful context for the readings that follow<br>* An introduction precedes each selection, offering an overview of the article and a discussion of its relevance to students<br>* Lively discussion questions follow each reading<br><br>An essential resource for criminology courses, the new edition <em>Crime and Criminals</em> explores the dynamic, challenging, and ever-changing realities of crime.<br></p><p><br><strong>Frank R.

New, empty space was lit by innumerable baby stars and infant galaxies, their light finally reaching Earth many billions of years later.<p></p><p>Every scientific discovery about space and the stars, their beginnings as well as our own, derives from this ancient light. Here we track the history of the Universe and our quest to find our place within it.</p><p>The story begins among the rough-hewn rocks of ancient megaliths such as Stonehenge, when they are positioned to catch the rising Sun. It continues when the Greek genius Aristarchus pictures the geometry of Earth, Moon, and Sun, revealing the huge empty spaces between them; when Edwin Hubble shows that the Universe is getting ever larger; and when Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky finds that most of the Universe is missing. These moments were turning points, times when years of accumulated thought converged upon one astronomer s obsession: to turn a confounding puzzle into a discovery that changed the way we see the world. We call these Ponderables.</p><p>Here you will find the life and works of great astronomers as they watch the night sky, build observatories, discover galaxies, spot new objects and send probes into space. Together the insights of these great thinkers create an increasingly precise picture of an ever-expanding universe, one still full of mystery.</p><p>Today, the largest telescopes ever designed are probing farther into the Universe, deeper into the past, looking for clues to constantly evolving questions:</p><p>What are today s Imponderables, mysteries yet to be solved?</p><p>Where will they lead?</p><p>What will be the next discovery?</p><p>This lavishly illustrated volume Includes a removable fold-out concertina neatly housed in the back of the book.

It traces the fundamental and interlinked re-examination of the languages of the arts brought about by Matisse, Picasso, Schoenberg, Eliot, Apollinaire, Marinetti, Ben, and many others, which led to radically new techniques, such as atonality, cubism, and collage. These changes are set in the context both of the art that preceded them and of a new and profound shift in ideas. Theories of the unconscious, the association of ideas, primitivism, and reliance upon an expressionist intuition led to a reshaped conception of personal identity, and Butler examines the representation of the modernist self in the work of figures including Mann, Joyce, Conrad, and Stravinsky.<br> <br> Accessible and wide-ranging, the book is lavishly illustrated with over sixty illustrations, many in color. It provides an elegant and incisive guide to a momentous period in the history of European art.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher Butler</strong> is Tutor in English Literature and Curator of Pictures at Christ Church, Oxford.<br><br>"A refreshingly generous and generally sensitive account of the early influences on, and the development of, the Modernist movement....

Anyone interested in either modernism or the postmodern should read it."--<em>Wyndham Lewis</em> <em>Annual</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Architecture and Ornament: An Illustrated Dictionary</h2><p>For architects, historians, preservationists, students or homeowners, this richly illustrated two-part dictionary makes it easy to identify a specific architectural detail even if you have no idea what the technical term for it is. Unlike traditional dictionaries that require you to know the name of the term before you look it up, this work allows you to visually identify a particular building element in a series of illustrations. Once the visual identification is made, the name of the term is given, making it simple for you to look it up in the traditional architectural dictionary section of the work. The illustrations are arranged by main categories with common labels--windows and doors; walls; roofs; columns; stairs; ornament and moldings; and arches, vaults and domes. For example, one would find illustrations for many types of columns, such as Tuscan, Doric, and Corinthian, and then could find many parts of these columns further identified. This broad range of architectural illustrations allows the work to function not only as a traditional architectural dictionary, but also as a design source or as an overview of architectural ornament and detailing.</p><p>Architectural historian Margaret Maliszewski has worked with the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and with architectural and planning firms in Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.

Shorn of the truly rotten illusion that the world is a fulfilling and meaningful place, these subjects identify themselves by a paradoxical disidentification&#x2015;through the objects that take their places. They have mastered the art of living absently, of making something with nothing. Traversing their own morbid obsessions, they substitute the nonsensical for sense, the ridiculous for the meaningful.</p><p>Kukuljevic analyzes a series of artistic practices that illuminate this subjectivity, ranging from Marcel Duchamp's <i>Three Standard Stoppages</i> to Charles Baudelaire's melancholia. He considers the paradox of Duchamp's apparatus in the <i>Stoppages</i> and the strange comedy of Marcel Broodthaers's relation to the readymade; the comic subject in Jacques Vach� and the ridiculous subject in Alfred Jarry; the nihilist in Paul Val�ry's <i>Monsieur Teste</i>; Oswald Wiener's interpretation of the dandy; and Charles Baudelaire as a happy melancholic. Along the way, he also touches on the work of Thomas Bernhard, Andy Kaufman, Buster Keaton, and others. Finally, he offers an extended analysis of Danny's escape from his demented father in Stanley Kubrick's <i>The Shining</i>. </p><p>Each of these subjects is, in Freud's terms, sick&#x2015;sick in the specific sense that they assume the absence of meaning and the liquidation of value in the world. They concern themselves with art, without assuming its value or meaning. Utterly debased, fundamentally disoriented, they take the void as their medium.</p></p><p>Alexi Kukuljevic is an artist and Lecturer in Art Theory at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna.<p><i>Liquidation World</i> pushes the analysis of subjectivation as personal dissolution farther than anyone has done previously, charting its transformation from theoretical predicament to existential quandary to cultural pathology concentrated in the self-liquidating persona of the artist.

Yet as a personality, Piero remains a mystery. He leaves an enigmatic legacy that ranges from the merging of religion and mathematics to his use of perspective to make painting a "true science." In this engaging narrative, Larry Witham transports us to Piero's tumultuous age, a world of princes and popes, soldiers and schisms.&nbsp;<em>Piero's Light</em>&nbsp;also reveals how he was part of the philosophical revival of Platonism, an ancient worldview that would shape art, religion, and science's transition toward modernity. Just sixteen of Piero's paintings survive, but these images and his writings would fuel some of the greatest art historical debates of all time. Through Witham's wide research, Piero emerges as a figure who marks a turning point in Western culture. Our past understanding of faith, beauty, and knowledge has been radically altered by a secular age, and the story of Piero helps us understand how this has taken place. The search for Piero has continued among both intrepid scholars and art lovers of all kinds, and it is no wonder: few artists in history take us as deeply into the intellectual excitement of the Renaissance as Piero della Francesca. <em><em><em></em></em></em> <em><em><em><em></em></em></em></em> <em><em><em><em></em></em></em></em> <em><em><em><em></em></em></em></em> <em><em><em><strong></strong></em></em></em> <em><em><em><strong></strong></em></em></em> <em><em><em><strong></strong></em></em></em></p><p><em>The story of one remarkable artist of the early Italian Renaissance--a painter at the crossroads of our modern revolutions in art, religion, science--who remains a figure of enduring fascination in the twenty-first century.</em><br><i></i><br> In the heart of Tuscany, Piero della Francesca became a painter and mathematician at the dawn of the Renaissance, revealing his innovative mind in some of the best known images from that period, and in his unusual writings on geometry. Yet as a personality, Piero remains a mystery. He leaves an enigmatic legacy that ranges from the merging of religion and mathematics to his use of perspective to make painting a "true science." In this engaging narrative, Larry Witham transports us to Piero's tumultuous age, a world of princes and popes, soldiers and schisms.&nbsp;<em>Piero's Light</em>&nbsp;also reveals how he was part of the philosophical revival of Platonism, an ancient worldview that would shape art, religion, and science's transition toward modernity. Just sixteen of Piero's paintings survive, but these images and his writings would fuel some of the greatest art historical debates of all time.

The primary material in her work is the live female figure, which remains ephemeral and separate. These women, mainly unclothed, similar, unified through details like hair color, or identical shoes, stand motionless, unapproachable and regimented in the space while viewers watch them. Neither performance nor documentary, Beecroft&#39;s live events are recorded through photography and film, but her conceptual approach is actually closer to painting: she makes contemporary versions of the complex figurative compositions that have challenged painters from the Renaissance onwards. Beecroft&#39;s more recent work has a slightly more theatrical approach--the uniforms are period clothing, not nudity, and some of her performances include food, while others have featured men in military attire. The artist&#39;s provocative tabeaux are accompanied here by the drawings and backstage Polaroids she uses in planning her often-disturbing performances. Includes an extensive interview with Beecroft, which touches on topics informing her work, including men, anorexia, exercise, family, film and beauty.</p><p></p><h2>Integrative Couple Therapy: Promoting Acceptance and Change</h2><p>To have a successful marriage, couples need to develop the ability to accept the unchangeable and change what can be changed. This realistic premise is at the heart of integrative couple therapy, the first approach to embrace both techniques for fostering acceptance and techniques for fostering change.<br>The book offers rich clinical detail on how to develop a formulation encompassing the couple's disparate conflict areas, enhance intimacy through acceptance, build tolerance for difference, and improve communication and problem-solving. The clinical implications of diversity in gender, culture, ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation are taken into account, as are issues related to domestic violence, infidelity, depression, and drug and alcohol addiction.<br>Integrative couple therapy creates a context in which partners can accept in each other what cannot be changed, change what they can, and compassionately, realistically recognize the difference.</p><p>Neil S.

The four directors&#x2014;Konstantin Stanislavsky, Bertolt Brecht, Elia Kazan, and Peter Brook&#x2014;all were monarchs of the profession in their time. Without their work, theatre in the twentieth century&#x2014;so often called "the century of the director" &#x2014;would have a radically different shape and meaning. The four men are also among the dozen or so modern directors whose theatrical achievements have become culture phenomena. In histories, theories, hagiographies, and polemics, these directors are conferred classic stature, as are the four plays on which they worked. Chekhov's The Seagull, Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children, and Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire have long been recognized, in the theatre and in the study, as masterpieces. They are anthologized, quoted, taught, parodied, read, and produced constantly and globally. The culturally conservative might question the presence of MaratiSade in such august company, but Peter Weiss's play stands every chance of figuring in Western repertories, classroom study, and theatrical histories until well into the twenty-first century. In their quite different ways, these are all classics of that Western drama which is part of our immediate heritage.</p><p>"The book is organized like a set of four casebooks, and it encapsulates, succinctly and with remarkably little jargon, four crucial ages in the life of modern theatre."--John Peter, Times Literary Supplement&nbsp;"These four chapters present directors in different postures: Stanislavsky with his thorough paper visualization of The Seagull, Brecht as pedagogue paying relentless attention to detail, Kazan 'in the complexity of high-wire directing in the high-pressure commercial zone,' and Brook as the 'director auteur whose productions originate in his workshop.'. . . A valuable and often fascinating book."--Gerard Werson, The Stage&nbsp;"This book offers four brilliant essays on the rarely handled art of stage directing. In reconstructing four of the most influential productions in recent history, Dr. Jones fills a gap in the literature of modern directing. &nbsp;. . .Theater historians, critics, and practitioners should receive this book as an outstanding contribution to the art and craft of the living stage."--William Melnitz, University of California, Los AngelesDavid Richard Jones teaches English and Theatre Arts at the University of New Mexico.</p><h2>Complete Mediterranean Wildlife: Photoguide</h2><p><p>The only guide currently available for the region, Complete Mediterranean Wildlife describes and illustrates 1500 species commonly found in the world&#x2019;s most popular holiday destination.</p><p>Mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, butterflies and moths, other insects, spiders, slugs and snails, trees and flowering plants are all included, and each section is coded with a symbol for quick reference.</p><p>From Cyprus in the east to the western end of the Mediterranean, the guide also covers species found in Portugal and the Algarve.

In fact, over the centuries there have been many "yogas"--yogas of battlefield warriors, of itinerant minstrels and beggars, of religious reformers, and of course, the yogas of mind and body so popular today. <i>Yoga in Practice</i> is an anthology of primary texts drawn from the diverse yoga traditions of India, greater Asia, and the West. This one-of-a-kind sourcebook features elegant translations of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, and even Islamic yogic writings, many of them being made available in English for the very first time. Collected here are ancient, colonial, and modern texts reflecting a broad range of genres, from an early medical treatise in Sanskrit to Upanishadic verses on sacred sounds; from a Tibetan catechetical dialogue to funerary and devotional songs still sung in India today; and from a 1930s instructional guide by the grandfather of contemporary yoga to the private papers of a pioneer of tantric yoga in America.</p><br><p> Emphasizing the lived experiences to be found in the many worlds of yoga, <i>Yoga in Practice</i> includes David Gordon White's informative general introduction as well as concise introductions to each reading by the book's contributors.</p></p><p><p>"This volume fills a vacuum in yoga studies. An indispensable resource for teachers and students, it is also of immeasurable value to every thinking yoga practitioner. Through an astute selection of key texts, White effectively demonstrates that yoga is a collection of vibrant, disparate, and distinctive traditions, and he also highlights continuities that unite ideas and practices of yoga through two thousand years of history."<b>--Suzanne Newcombe, <i>Inform</i>, based at the London School of Economics and Political Science</b></p><p>"<i>Yoga in Practice</i> deals with a topic of great academic significance and broad popular appeal, and the contributors are solid scholars who know their material inside out. Yoga is a global phenomenon, and this collection provides clarification of key points and careful contextualization of the history of ideas that has produced yoga. There are really no other books comparable in range, presentation, or quality."<b>--Joseph S. Alter, University of Pittsburgh</b></p><p>"This anthology makes available a wide variety of translations of primary sources on yoga, especially texts focused on practice, and places each in the broader context of the Indian traditions of yoga. The volume breaks new ground by including little-known texts and offering new perspectives on more familiar ones. Many of these texts are unavailable in translation elsewhere."<b>--David Carpenter, Saint Joseph's University</b></p><b>David Gordon White</b> is the J. F.

Many people today assume that the Bible is full of errors and contradictions. At best, it is a mildly interesting look at the lives and beliefs of people who lived centuries ago.</p><p>In this booklet, Dr. R.C. Sproul shows that these common assumptions are wrong.

Less well known, Hokusai was a highly accomplished and prolific painter who produced not only pictures of courtesans of the pleasure quarters, the normal stock-in-trade of an ukiyo-e artist, but also a prodigious output based on historical and legendary themes. This volume provides new insights into all these diverse aspects of the polyvalent artist's corpus.</p><p>&#34;This beautifully produced volume collects essays by 15 specialists in Japanese art and may be seen as a kind of sequel to &#39;Hokusai Paintings: Selected Essays&#39; published some 10 years ago...All of the essays are splendidly illustrated, and the general luxuriousness of the format and the production make this among the most beautiful of recent books on Japanese Art.&#34;--The Japan Times</p><h2>Little Giant: The Life and Times of Speaker Carl Albert</h2><p><p>At age six, Carl Albert knew he wanted to serve in the United States Congress. In 1947 he realized his dream when he was elected to serve in the House of Representatives alongside John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon. In Little Giant, Albert relates the story of his life in Oklahoma and his road to Congress, where after eight years of service he joined its leadership and shaped the legislation known as Kennedy�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s New Frontier and Johnson�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Great Society. In 1971 he began his own Speakership; six years later, when it ended, Congress had been reshaped and had weathered the constitutional crisis of Richard Nixon�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s "Imperial Presidency."</p></p><p><p><b>Danney Goble</b> (1946&#x2013;2007) was Professor of Letters at the University of Oklahoma and the award-winning author or coauthor of eight books about Oklahoma and Oklahomans.</p>Albert was elected to Congress from Oklahoma in 1947, became Democratic whip during the Eisenhower administration, House majority leader under Kennedy and Johnson, and served as Speaker of the House from 1971 to 1977. In his amiable, folksy memoir, written with Goble, associate professor of history at the University of Tulsa, Albert modestly describes his role in shaping legislation, but becomes specific in evaluating those with whom he worked during 30 years of public service. Lyndon Johnson, in his view, was a consummate politician, "obsessed" with politics and at times remarkably aggressive in making demands on the Speaker (he was "beside me, behind me, and seemingly all over me"). Albert considers Richard Nixon a brilliant political strategist but a flawed man: as President he "needed something to govern against," and, according to Albert, that something was nothing less than the U.S. Congress.

He was a <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> Journalist and cartoonist for twenty years, during the time of the Zodiac killings. In addition to being a bestselling author, he has been a Foreign Press Club Award winner, a Pulitzer Prize nominee, a prize winning syndicated political cartoonist, and a gold medal illustrator. He lives in the San Francisco Bay area.Rarely have the crimes of a serial murderer captured the imagination and fears of the entire country as did the unsolved &#34;Zodiac&#34; killings in the Bay Area in the 1970s. Close to the investigators and long obsessed with the case, Graysmith reputedly knows more about the killer than anyone else. His popular 1986 Zodiac offered such a thorough account that even a lead investigator used it as a reference. In that book, , seasoned true-crime author Graysmith identified the most likely suspect though only under a pseudonym, Richard Starr, hoping the book would trigger a reader to come forward with incontrovertible evidence. The suspect died in 1992, and in this follow-up to Zodiac, Graysmith now identifies &#34;Starr&#34; by his real name, Arthur Leigh Allen, a terrifying sociopath and convicted pedophile whom police long considered the prime suspect. Culled from official records and new interviews conducted in recent years, the latest book excavates the still burgeoning 30-year history of investigations into the Zodiac murders six confirmed and dozens of others that the killer claimed to have committed, and who spawned a score of copycat killers, most recently a 15-year-old from Kobe, Japan. The Zodiac case is convoluted at its heart and though Graysmith&#39;s evidence against Allen plays solidly, the narrative often gives way to unexpected segues and jumps in time. To keep track of this case that has more facets than a diamond, readers will need a scorecard.

The book chronicles a year in the life of Thaxter&#x2019;s garden on the island her father had purchased in 1848 and renamed Appledore Island. The hotel he built there was among New England&#x2019;s first offshore summer resorts and attracted writers, musicians, and artists, including the American Impressionist Childe Hassam, whose beautiful paintings of Thaxter&#x2019;s house and garden are reproduced in this book. Considered one of the most delightful examples of horticultural writing, AN ISLAND GARDEN has served as an inspiration for essayists and gardeners alike since its first publication.</p><p>About the time the facsimile edition was first published, Celia Thaxter's garden was restored by volunteers according to the plans noted in this book. It is open to visitors through arrangements with Cornell University's marine laboratory on nearby Star Island, off the coast of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. <p>Childe (Frederick) Hassam was an American painter and etcher born in Dorchester, Massachusetts and educated at the Boston Art School and the �cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His works include July 14 Rue Daunon (1910) and Church at Gloucester (1918), both in the Metropolitan Museum, New York City.</p>Hassam&#39;s masterful renderings of the garden and island ... are as important to American Impressionism as Monet&#39;s poppy pictures or paintings of his garden at Giverny are to French Impressionism --Home and Garden Magazine</p><h2>Report Verses in Rudolf Steiner&#39;s Art of Education: Healing Forces in Words and Their Rhythms</h2><p><p>This book is a concise exploration of Rudolf Steiner's recommendation that class teachers create verses for their pupils to be inserted into their annual school reports.

She draws her strength from that solid foundation, bringing delight and beauty to her elderly husband, to the small town of Sweet Water where they live, to the prairie land itself, and to the young narrator of her story, Neil Herbert. All are bewitched by her brilliance and grace, and all are ultimately betrayed. For Marian longs for &#34;life on any terms&#34;, and in fulfilling herself, she loses all she loved and all who loved her. This, Willa Cather&#39;s most perfect novel, is not only a portrait of a troubling beauty, but also a haunting evocation of a noble age slipping irrevocably into the past.First published in 1923, A Lost Lady is one of Willa Cather&#39;s classic novels about life on the Great Plains. It harkens back to Nebraska&#39;s early history and contrasts those days with an unsentimental portrait of the materialistic world that supplanted the frontier. In her subtle portrait of Marian Forrester, whose life unfolds in the midst of this disquieting transition, Cather created one of her most memorable and finely drawn characters. The Willa Cather Scholarly Edition of A Lost Lady is edited according to standards set by the Committee for Scholarly Editions of the Modern Language Association. A wide range of biographical, historical, and textual information about the novel is presented. A selection of archival photographs illuminates the connection between the photographs illuminates the connection between the novel and the people and places from Cather&#39;s formative years in Nebraska.</p><h2>The Undergrowth of Science: Delusion, Self-Deception and Human Frailty</h2><p>We think of scientists as sober, precise thinkers, but they can be wildly off the mark. Consider cold fusion, N-rays, or polywater--three "discoveries" that turned out to be complete nonsense. But serious scientists somehow convinced themselves that they were real.<br> In <em>The Undergrowth of Science</em>, Walter Gratzer recounts the blind alleys that honest, dedicated researchers have wandered down--and had to be dragged out of by more cool-headed colleagues. Self-deception runs through each of Gratzer's many examples, a distressing if sometimes hilarious theme. We meet the American researchers who convinced themselves that memories were captured in RNA molecules; if extracts from the brains of trained rats were injected into the untrained, they argued, the knowledge was passed along. Gratzer also describes the group of serious scientists took up the cause of Uri Geller and assorted 11-year-old children who claimed to have the power to bend spoons with their minds--but only if the observers wanted them to succeed. When less biased researchers saw the children slyly bending the cutlery with their feet, their scientific defenders voiced outrage at the unfairness of the test. Politics sometimes plays a role as well, as it did when the U.S. government spent millions looking into the strange and miraculous Soviet invention of polywater. It turned out to be normal water contaminated with silicates.<br> Gratzer guides us through the rogue's gallery of false discoveries, from mitogenic radiation to the recent (and infamous) cold fusion. Informative and entertaining, yet with a serious point to make, this book offers much insight into why good science sometimes goes bad.</p><p>Unfortunately for debunkers like the Amazing Randi, the distinction between science and pseudoscience can get a bit fuzzy. Biophysicist Walter Gratzer pokes gently through the mulch of dead ideas in <i>The Undergrowth of Science</i>, a smart, witty collection of cautionary research tales. Some are widely familiar, like his long chapter on the Soviet politicization of genetics, while others have been examined less minutely--does anyone remember the horror of menstrual toxins? Gratzer treats his subjects warmly, for the most part, while reserving some venom for the foolishness and evil of Nazi eugenics and other racist and nationalist visions of the world.<p> The book asks its readers to adopt a sophisticated skepticism, one that won't accept polywater or memory transfer with zeal but also won't rigorously reject continental drift or other crazy-but-correct ideas. Of course, Gratzer acknowledges that it's easiest to be skeptical with perfect hindsight, but by building on Langmuir's rules for recognizing "pathological science," he hopes to establish a more thoughtful scientific readership. While some scientists would just as soon see any reference to travesties like cold fusion go down the memory hole, <i>The Undergrowth of Science</i> reminds us to learn from our mistakes. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><br><strong>Walter Gratzer</strong> is a biophysicist at the Randall Institute, King's College London.

The Fed's power, which derives from its ability to alter the money supply and move interest rates, weighs heavily not only on the US economy, but on the world economy as well. Not surprisingly, most scholarship on the Fed has focused on its economic role; however, the Fed's power isn't merely economic but is also political. Since its decisions benefit some economic sectors (and hence interest groups) and not others, it effectively makes political choices when shaping economic policy. <br><br>Lawrence R. Jacobs and Desmond King's <em>Fed Power</em> is the first sustained synthesis of the Fed's political role-especially the way in which it uses its power to benefit some interest groups and not others-since the 2008 financial crisis. The book closely examines the Fed's unilateral actions during the 2008-2009 financial crisis when it leveraged half of the country's net worth without a congressional vote or presidential authorization. While the country was spared a second depression, the Fed's actions doled out lopsided benefits to finance. The Fed's favoritism and unprecedented assertions of power provoked public unease and a bipartisan congressional backlash to restrain it. <em>Fed Power</em> concludes with bold proposals to reform America's financial management to prevent future crises and to restore democratic accountability. A powerful critique of how the Federal Reserve governs the American economy, <em>Fed Power</em> will be essential reading for anyone interested in how inequality has increased since 2009, even throughout a liberal presidency committed to reducing inequality.<br></p><p><br><strong>Lawrence R.

Mellon Professor of American Government at Oxford University and author of <em>Making Americans</em> (Harvard), as well as co-author of <em>Still a House Divided</em> (Princeton).<br><br>"[A] careful argument for balancing sound financial management and the public interest." <br>--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"[A] groundbreaking book...<em>Fed Power</em> represents a vibrant form of 21st century financial populism and a vital intervention in our political and social debates." <br>--<em>The Huffington Post</em> <br><p></p><br>"[Jacobs and King] use the tools of political science to examine the Federal Reserve as an institution... [and] argue that the democratic accountability of the Federal Reserve has suffered because of the bailouts. And it's completely true that the Federal Reserve pushed their powers beyond what anyone had expected... There is a lot to be impressed with in this book." <br>--<em>The American Prospect</em> <br><p></p><br>"A welcome demonstration that grounded academic work can be entertaining as well as informative. Lawrence Jacobs and Desmond King, political scientists from the universities of Minnesota and Oxford respectively, live up to their claim to 'jettison the all-too-common hermetic language of academia in favor of candor and directness'... A book that is engaging throughout and generally persuasive in its principal thesis that the Fed is a politically loaded institution that drives rising inequality." <br>--<em>The Financial Times</em>, Philip Augar <br><p></p><br>"Jacobs and King bring a political economy perspective to the debate...

But while most of us today can work a computer--albeit with the help of the ever-present computer software manual--we know little about what goes on inside the box and virtually nothing about software design or the world of computer programming.<br> In <em>Patterns of Software</em>, the respected software pioneer and computer scientist, Richard Gabriel, gives us an informative inside look at the world of software design and computer programming and the business that surrounds them. In this wide-ranging volume, Gabriel discusses such topics as what makes a successful programming language, how the rest of the world looks at and responds to the work of computer scientists, how he first became involved in computer programming and software development, what makes a successful software business, and why his own company, Lucid, failed in 1994, ten years after its inception.<br> Perhaps the most interesting and enlightening section of the book is Gabriel's detailed look at what he believes are the lessons that can be learned from architect Christopher Alexander, whose books--including the seminal <em>A Pattern Language</em>--have had a profound influence on the computer programming community. Gabriel illuminates some of Alexander's key insights--"the quality without a name," pattern languages, habitability, piecemeal growth--and reveals how these influential architectural ideas apply equally well to the construction of a computer program. Gabriel explains the concept of habitability, for example, by comparing a program to a New England farmhouse and the surrounding structures which slowly grow and are modified according to the needs and desires of the people who live and work on the farm. "Programs live and grow, and their inhabitants--the programmers--need to work with that program the way the farmer works with the homestead."<br> Although computer scientists and software entrepreneurs will get much out of this book, the essays are accessible to everyone and will intrigue anyone curious about Silicon Valley, computer programming, or the world of high technology.</p><p>A wide-ranging set of essays by a long-time Silicon Valley insider.

Bairoch examines the development of cities from the dawn of urbanization (Jericho) to the explosive growth of the contemporary Third World city. In particular, he defines the roles of agriculture and industrialization in the rise of cities.<br> <br> "A hefty history, from the Neolithic onward. It's ambitious in scope and rich in subject, detailing urbanization and, of course, the links between cities and economies. Scholarly, accessible, and significant."&#x2014;<i>Newsday<br> <br></i> "This book offers a path-breaking synthesis of the vast literature on the history of urbanization."&#x2014;John C. Brown, <i>Journal of Economic Literature<br> <br></i> "One leaves this volume with the feeling of positions intelligently argued and related to the existing state of theory and knowledge. One also has the pleasure of reading a book unusually well-written. It will long both be a standard and stimulate new thought on the central issue of urban and economic growth."&#x2014;Thomas A.

There are as many answers to that question as there are architects involved. In this case, there are 61 architects and 61 very different houses. Whether your personal interest in houses is that of the professional architect or builder or that of the prospective homeowner, you&#39;ll find this volume a unique and provocative source of design ideas and innovative solutions to typical design problems. And you&#39;ll find these ideas presented in a manner that is both informative and interesting-because each of these architects explains not only why and how he designed his home as he did, but also how this home worked out for himself and his family once they were living in it. The editors asked each architect to describe-the problems he had in deciding upon a design-how his house differed from that he would have designed for a client-what he would do differently if he were starting over-how the house measured up to hopes, dreams, and plans-and whether he and his family still lived in the house. Their answers revealed that in almost every case some special consideration played a dominant role in shaping the design concept adopted by the architect. It seemed logical, therefore, to group together descriptions of those homes that shared the same basic determining factor. Site-Many architects began, of course, with a particular site, chosen, for example, because of a treasured view or location, or because it was available, with its irregularities and problems, at a lower price than neighboring parcels....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia</h2><p>The main architect of the concept of perestroika under Gorbachev, Alexander N.

Discusses Carnegies role in reorganizing the whole pattern of industrial activity. Softcover. DLC: Carnegie, Andrew, 1835-1919.</p><p>Editor's Preface <p> The term "industrial revolution" has become a catch phrase that obscures rather than clarifies. All too often it conveys the impression that the economic process which transformed the modern world began with an event at some point in eighteenthcentury England, from which all subsequent consequences proceeded smoothly and continuously. </p><p> The actuality was far more complex. The basic changes stretched over two hundred years and are not yet over. They involved not only the new technology of machines, but also profound alterations in the organization of work and in habits of the mind. </p><p> Andrew Carnegie exemplified one phase of the change. He arrived in the United States at a crucial moment in its development. When the small boy Andy and his family left Scotland, British industrialization was well underway; indeed, their migration resulted from one of its unexpected consequences. When the Carnegies reached Pittsburgh, Americans had already begun to move in the same direction; the founding of the early manufacturing mills at Lowell, Massachusetts, was decades past. Significantly, Carnegie's first job was as a bobbin boy in a textile mill. But both countries had taken only the first hesitant steps in industrialization. Manufacturing was still primarily a rural activity and still small in scale. </p><p> Carnegie was involved in reorganizing the whole pattern of industrial activity. Early in his career he changed jobs, moving from textiles to the telegraph office and then to the railroads. Those shifts were symbolic insofar as they brought him into contact with the dynamic forces that were altering communications and were creating large regional economic units to replace the earlier, small ones. Much of what he learned about communications and transportation he later ingeniously adapted to the steel industry. </p><p> Carnegie also exemplified the habits of mind important at one stage of industrial development. He was a Scot, a fact most clearly manifest in the ethnic links that helped at each point in his career. He showed the capacity to use capital and technicians well, not in a speculative or an exploitive fashion, but to create wealth. That he remained apart from the corporate developments commonly associated with the closing decade of the nineteenth century-as, indeed, did his contemporary Andrew W. Melton-was not an accident. When he finally sold out to United States Steel, he closed his own career and also the stage of development in which he had actively participated. By then, however, as Harold C. Livesay's book shows, Carnegie had helped to establish the foundations of American economic power. </p><p> Oscar Handlin</p>In this biography, author and scholar Harold C. Livesay examines the life and legacy of Andrew Carnegie, one of the greatest captains of industry and philanthropists in the history of the United States. Paperback, brief, and inexpensive, each of the titles in the &#34;Library of American Biography Series&#34; focuses on a figure whose actions and ideas significantly influenced the course of American history and national life. In addition, each biography relates the life of its subject to the broader themes and developments of the times.</p><h2>Study Guide On Cooking: A Textbook of Culinary Fundamentals, 4th Edition</h2><p>Each chapter contains: * Fill in the Blank Questions* Short Anwer Questions* Matching Questions* Multiple Choice Questions* True / False Questions* Chapter Review* Essay Questions* Answer Key</p><p></p><h2>Ultimate Questions</h2><p><p><b>How to live meaningfully in the face of the unknowable</b></p><p>We human beings had no say in existing&#x2015;we just opened our eyes and found ourselves here. We have a fundamental need to understand who we are and the world we live in. Reason takes us a long way, but mystery remains. When our minds and senses are baffled, faith can seem justified&#x2015;but faith is not knowledge. In <i>Ultimate Questions</i>, acclaimed philosopher Bryan Magee provocatively argues that we have no way of fathoming our own natures or finding definitive answers to the big questions we all face.</p><p>With eloquence and grace, Magee urges us to be the mapmakers of what is intelligible, and to identify the boundaries of meaningfulness. He traces this tradition of thought to his chief philosophical mentors&#x2015;Locke, Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer&#x2015;and shows why this approach to the enigma of existence can enrich our lives and transform our understanding of the human predicament. As Magee puts it, "There is a world of difference between being lost in the daylight and being lost in the dark."</p><p>The crowning achievement to a distinguished philosophical career, <i>Ultimate Questions</i> is a deeply personal meditation on the meaning of life and the ways we should live and face death.</p></p><p><p>"In this fluently written and beautifully clear book, Bryan Magee offers a series of reflections on the human condition, based on a lifetime's study of the central questions of philosophy. <i>Ultimate Questions</i> is a personal testament, one that reflects a yearning for answers coupled with an honest, and indeed humble, admission that such answers cannot be reached."<b>--John Cottingham, author of <i>Philosophy of Religion: Towards a More Humane Approach</i></b></p><b>Bryan Magee</b> has had an unusually multifaceted career as a professor of philosophy, music and theater critic, BBC broadcaster, and member of Parliament.

"Savoir," by H�l�ne Cixous, is a brief but densely layered account of her experience of recovered sight after a lifetime of severe myopia, an experience that ends with the unexpected turn of grieving for what is lost. Her literary inventiveness mines the coincidence in French between the two verbs <i>savoir</i> (to know) and <i>voir</i> (to see). Jacques Derrida's "A Silkworm of One's Own" complexly muses on a host of autobiographical, philosophical, and religious motifs&#x2015;including his varied responses to "Savoir." The two texts are accompanied by six beautiful and evocative drawings that play on the theme of drapery over portions of the body.</p> <p><i>Veils</i> suspends sexual difference between two homonyms: <i>la voile</i> (sail) and <i>le voile</i> (veil). A whole history of sexual difference is enveloped, sometimes dissimulated here&#x2015;in the folds of sails and veils and in the turns, journeys, and returns of their metaphors and metonymies.</p> <p>However foreign to each other they may appear, however autonomous they may be, the two texts participate in a common genre: autobiography, confession, memoirs. The future also enters in: by opening to each other, the two discourses confide what is about to happen, the <i>imminence</i> of an event lacking any common measure with them or with anything else, an operation that restores sight and plunges into mourning the knowledge of the previous night, a "verdict" whose threatening secret remains out of reach by our knowledge.</p></p><p>&#x201c;This book is a significant event in contemporary French letters. Although Cixous and Derrida have often signaled publicly their solidarity with each other, this book conjoins their writing at an altogether new level of intensity.

Brian Davies provides a critical examination of the fundamental questions of religion and the ways in which these questions have been treated by such thinkers as Anselm, Aquinas, Descartes, Leibnitz, Hume, Kant, Karl Barth, and Wittgenstein. Must a belief in God be based on argument or evidence in order to be a rational belief? Can one invoke the Free-Will Defense if one believes in God as maker and sustainer of the universe? Is it correct to think of God as a moral agent subject to duties and obligations? What is the significance of Darwin for the Argument from Design? How can one recognize God as an object of one&#39;s experience? The author debates these questions and more, sometimes proposing provocative answers of his own, more often leaving readers to decide for themselves.</p><p>Brian Davies has taught at Bristol, and in Rome and New York.

Sex and the State explores these patterns of gender-related policy reform and shows how they mattered for the peoples of Latin America and for a broader understanding of the logic behind the state&#39;s role in shaping private lives and gender relations everywhere."This remarkable book will immediately establish Htun as a major thinker on Latin America, gender, and theories of dictatorship and democratization. Masterfully challenging much conventional wisdom, she offers a fascinating exegesis of how Argentina, Brazil, and Chile responded to challenges to their traditional patriarchal laws on family life and gender relations between the 1960s and the 1990s." Foreign Affairs<br><br>"Thinly disguised as a book about family and women's issues, Sex and the State is a scathing analysis of politics in three of Latin America's most important countries. Sadly, hypocrisy seems to be a main theme, at least when dealing with issues of sex and gender. Chile forbids divorce, but its courts freely hand out fraudulent annulments. Abortion is banned everywhere, but is available at the best hospitals and clinics. The church is an exemplary defender of human rights and the rights of the poor, except when these are claimed by poor women. The book, however, offers more than incisive political analysis. It provides a series of good, practical and often surprising proposals to deal with the hypocrisy. These will be of great value to governments, international organizations, and NGOs." Peter Hakim, President of the Inter-American Dialogue<br><br>"Sex and the State illuminates the ways in which policy innovation occurs, what shapes the terms of debate on the age-old question of the separation of church and state, and why the influence of the Catholic Church on social policy looms larger at some times and in some places than others. In this book of sweeping breadth, Htun admirably does justice to the normative traditions, moral reflections, and political passions that drove the feminists, bishops, dictators, and democratic politicians to adopt the positions they did in the public policy debates governing the state regulation of the most intimate aspects of private life. After two decades of scholarship on the subject, this is simply the most important book yet to appear on gender and politics in Latin America." Frances Hagopian, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"Sex and the State demonstrates persuasively that gender-related issues cannot be lumped together simply because they pertain to women. This masterful study develops a series of bold theoretical claims about the distinct logics that guide the outcomes of debates over three controversial policy issues: abortion, divorce, and equality within the family. It derives these findings from careful historical research and hundreds of interviews with policymakers: politicians, feminist activists, religious leaders, lawyers, and academics. It reveals a deep understanding of the complex array of factors that have shaped these debates in the Southern Cone. These analytically important findings give theoretical justification to the relatively recent development of single-issue networks within the feminist community. The book speaks to important debates within the literatures on legal reform, gender and politics, public policy, and democratization."

Truth was not something that could be observed: instead, it was something made in the way that paintings were made--through the exercise of fantasy.</p><br><p> Juxtaposing paintings and texts, Bull presents the masterpieces of late Baroque painting in early eighteenth-century Naples from an entirely new perspective. Revealing the close connections between the arguments of the philosophers and the arguments of the painters, he shows how Vico drew on both in his influential philosophy of history, <i>The New Science</i>. Bull suggests that painting can serve not just as an illustration for philosophical arguments, but also as the model for them--that painting itself has sometimes been a form of epistemological experiment, and that, perhaps surprisingly, the Neapolitan Baroque may have been one of the routes through which modern consciousness was formed.</p></p><p><p>"Bull is a scholar with a gift for traversing traditional disciplinary boundaries, and his book acknowledges, as has rarely been done before, the wide philosophical dimensions of artistic practice in the 'long seventeenth century.' Given its originality of focus, this synthesis helps reconceptualize the period in a new way."<b>--Tom Nichols, University of Glasgow</b></p><p>"Malcolm Bull is an extraordinary writer--lucid, far reaching, and entirely original. His book explains how painting does not merely provide the subject for philosophical debate when we interpret, but also, quite by itself, manifests a form of philosophical thinking. In what way do the fantasies represented in art manifest a truthful way of thinking? This book offers the answer."<b>--David Carrier, coauthor of <i>Wild Art</i></b></p><b>Malcolm Bull</b> is university lecturer in fine art at the University of Oxford.

Numerous examples and problems are used to illustrate principles and concepts. DLC: Vibration.</p><p><p>This text serves as an introduction to the subject of vibration engineering at the undergraduate level. The style of the prior editions has been retained, with the theory, computational aspects, and applications of vibrations presented in as simple a manner as possible. As in the previous editions, computer techniques of analysis are emphasized. Expanded explanations of the fundamentals are given, emphasizing physical significance and interpretation that build upon previous experiences in undergraduate mechanics. Numerous examples and problems are used to illustrate principles and concepts. Favorable reactions and encouragement from professors and students have provided me with the impetus to write the third edition of this book. Several new sections have been added and many topics modified and rewritten. Most of the additions were suggested by those who have used the text and by numerous reviewers. Some important changes should be noted:</p><p> </p><p>The sections on the history of vibration, harmonic motion and harmonic analysis are expanded in Chapter 1. </p><p>In Chapter 3 the section on self-excitation and stability analysis has been rewritten and expanded. </p><p>A section on earthquake response spectra has been added to Chapter 4. </p><p>Two new sections, Using Newton's Second Law to Drive Equations of Motion and Free Vibration of Undamped Systems, have been added to Chapter 6. </p><p>A section on forced vibration of beams has been added to Chapter 8. </p><p>The sections on isolation and absorbers have been expanded in Chapter 9. </p><p>The section on experimental modal analysis has been rewritten and a new section on machine condition monitoring and diagnosis has been added to Chapter 10. </p><p>A section on chaos has been added to Chapter 13. </p><p>A section on response of a multidegree of freedom system has been added to Chapter 14. </p><p>Two new appendixes, on mathematical relationships and deflection of beams and plates, are now included. </p><p>Approximately 30 new illustrative examples appear throughout the book. </p><p>More than 220 new problems have been added at the ends of various chapters. </p><p>In several chapters, more project type problems are now included. Features </p><p>Each topic in Mechanical Vibrations is self-contained, with all concepts explained fully and the derivations presented with complete details. The computational aspects are emphasized throughout the book. Several Fortran computer programs, most of them in the form of general purpose subroutines, are included in the diskette accompanying the book. These programs are given for use by the students. Although the programs have been tested, no warranty is implied as to their accuracy. Problems that are based on the use/development of computer programs are given at the end of each chapter and expose students to many important computational and programming details. </p><p>Certain subjects are presented in a somewhat unconventional manner. The topics of Chapters 9, 10, and 11 fall in this category. Most textbooks discuss isolators, absorbers, and balancing in different places. Since one of the main purposes of the study of vibrations is to control vibration response, all topics directly related to vibration control are given in Chapter 9. The vibration-measuring instruments, along with vibration exciters, experimental modal analysis procedures, and machine condition monitoring, are presented in Chapter 10. Similarly, all the numerical integration methods applicable to single- and multi-degree of freedom systems, as well as continuous systems, are unified in Chapter 11. </p><p>Specific features include the following: </p><p>Nearly 130 Illustrative examples accompanying most topics. </p><p>More than 50 review questions to help students in reviewing and testing their understanding of the text material. </p><p>Approximately 850 problems, with solutions in the instructor's manual. </p><p>More than 30 design project type problems at the ends of various chapters. </p><p>Twenty-three computer programs to aid students in the numerical implementation of the methods discussed in the text. </p><p>Biographical information about scientists and engineers who contributed to the development of the theory of vibrations given on the opening pages of chapters and appendixes. </p><p>A convenient format for all examples: Following the statement of each example, the known information, the quantities to be determined, and the approach to be used are first identified and then the detailed solution is given. Notation and Units </p><p>Both the SI and the English system of units have been used in the examples and problems. A list of symbols, along with the associated units in SI and English systems, is given following the Contents. A brief discussion of SI units as they apply to the field of vibrations is given in Appendix E. Arrows are used over symbols to denote column vectors and square brackets are used to indicate matrices. Contents </p><p>Mechanical Vibrations is organized into 14 chapters and 5 appendixes. The material of the book provides flexible options for different types of vibration courses. For a one-semester senior or duel-level course, Chapters 1 through 5, portions of Chapters 6, 7, 8, and 10, and Chapter 9 may be used. The course can be given a computer orientation by including Chapter 11 in place of Chapter 8. Alternatively, with Chapters 12, 13, and 14, the text has sufficient material for a one-year sequence at the senior level. For shorter courses, the instructor can select the topics, depending on the level and orientation of the course. The relative simplicity with which topics are presented also makes the book useful to practicing engineers for purposes of self-study and as a source of references and computer programs. </p><p>Chapter 1 starts with a brief discussion of the history and importance of vibrations. The basic concepts and terminology used in vibration analysis are introduced. The free vibration analysis of single degree of freedom undamped translational and torsional systems is given in Chapter 2. The effects of viscous, Coulomb, and hysteretic damping are also discussed. The harmonic response of single degree of freedom systems is considered in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 is concerned with the response of a single degree of freedom system under general forcing functions. The roles of convolution integral, Laplace transformation, and numerical methods are discussed. The concept of response spectrum is also introduced in this chapter. The free and forced vibration of two degree of freedom systems is considered in Chapter 5. The self-excited vibration and stability of the system are discussed. Chapter 6 presents the vibration analysis of multi-degree of freedom systems. Matrix methods of analysis are used for the presentation of the theory. The modal analysis procedure is described for the solution of forced vibration problems. Several methods of determining the natural frequencies of discrete systems are outlined in Chapter 7. The methods of Dunkerley, Rayleigh, Holzer, and Jacobi and matrix iteration are also discussed. The vibration analysis of continuous systems, including strings, bars, shafts, beams, and membranes is given in Chapter 8. The Rayleigh and Rayleigh-Ritz methods of finding the approximate natural frequencies are also described. Chapter 9 discusses the various aspects of vibration control, including the problems of elimination, isolation, and absorption. The balancing of rotting and reciprocating machines and the whirling of shafts are also considered. The vibration-measuring instruments, vibration exciters, and signal analysis are the topics of Chapter 10. Chapter 11 presents several numerical integration techniques for finding the dynamic response of discrete and continuous systems. The central difference, Runge-Kutta, Houbolt, Wilson, and Newmark methods are summarized and illustrated. Finite element analysis, with applications involving one-dimensional elements, is discussed in Chapter 12. An introductory treatment of nonlinear vibration, including a discussion of subharmonic and superharmonic oscillations, limit cycles, systems with time-dependent coefficients and chaos, is given in Chapter 13. The random vibration of linear vibration systems is considered in Chapter 14. Appendixes A and B focus on mathematical relationships and deflection of beams and plates, respectively. Finally, the basic relations of matrices, Laplace transforms, and SI units are outlined, respectively, in Appendixes C, D, and E.

The writers expose the underside of this new Afrocentrism&#x2014;the crackpot theories, the bullying of dissent, the naked appeals to violence. Three themes emerge:<br>� Political trials&#x2014;how the notorious cases of O.J. Simpson, Philadelphia's convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, and others have muddied our sense of truth, justice, and reason <br>� Afro-fascism&#x2014;how some influential black leaders such as Louis Farrakhan have fueled a separatist movement that seems to feed on the hatred of Jews, Koreans, and whites <br>� The new racism&#x2014;how racial pride, taken to its destructive extreme on the streets and in the schools of America, is leading to a society of bitter divisions.<br>Academic partisans have rewritten the textbooks to enshrine Afrocentric orthodoxy inside Ivy League walls; politically correct media reports have ignored the troubling implications. <b><i>The Race Card</i></b> is a cogent, compelling, and long-needed call for a return to reason.</p><p>Peter Collier and David Horowitz are nationally known writers, editors, and political commentators whose intellectual development arcs from early, influential support for the Black Panther movement to the forefront of neoconservatism.

They are the authors of <i>Destructive Generation,</i> and the bestselling political biographies The Kennedys, The Rockefellers, and The Fords. David Horowitz's memoirs, <i>Radical Son,</i> has recently been published by <i>The Free Press.</i>Essays edited by Collier and Horowitz explore how black separatists and others are attacking King's dream of a color-blind society. 'Afrocentrism' is fueling a separatist movement fed on hatred of others: that's the major theme which evolves from this collection, written by academics who analyze the situation. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Computational Geometry: An Introduction (Texts and Monographs in Computer Science)</h2><p><b>From the reviews:</b> "This book offers a coherent treatment, at the graduate textbook level, of the field that has come to be known in the last decade or so as computational geometry. ... ...

They attracted followers ranging from Thomas Jefferson, who laid out mastodon bones on the White House floor, to twentieth-century doctors who used their knowledge of new species to conquer epidemic diseases. Acclaimed science writer Richard Conniff brings these daredevil "species seekers" to vivid life. Alongside their globe-spanning tales of adventure, he recounts some of the most dramatic shifts in the history of human thought. At the start, everyone accepted that the Earth had been created for our benefit. We weren't sure where vegetable ended and animal began, we couldn't classify species, and we didn't understand the causes of disease. But all that changed as the species seekers introduced us to the pantheon of life on Earth&#x2015;and our place within it. 36 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Richard Coniff, a Guggenheim Fellow and winner of the National Magazine Award, writes for Smithsonian and National Geographic and is a frequent commentator on NPR&#39;s All Things Considered and a guest columnist for the New York Times.

Intellectual historian Richard Teichgraeber brings us the first scholarly edition of Veblen&#x2019;s classic, thoroughly edited, annotated, and indexed. An extensive introduction discusses the book&#x2019;s composition and publishing history, Veblen&#x2019;s debts to earlier critics of the American university, and the place of <i>The Higher Learning in America</i> in current debates about the American university.</p><p>Veblen&#x2019;s insights into the American university system at the outset of the twentieth century are as provocative today as they were when first published. Insisting that institutions of higher learning should be dedicated solely to the disinterested pursuit of knowledge, he urged American universities to abandon commitments to extraneous pursuits such as athletics, community service, and vocational education. He also believed that the corporate model of governance&#x2015;with university boards of trustees dominated by well-to-do businessmen and university presidents who functioned essentially as businessmen in academic dress&#x2015;mandated unsavory techniques of salesmanship and self-promotion that threatened to reduce institutions of higher learning to the status of competitive business enterprises.</p><p>With a detailed chronology, suggested readings, and comprehensive notes identifying events, individuals, and institutions to which Veblen alludes, this volume is sure to become the standard teaching text for Veblen&#x2019;s classic work and an invaluable resource for students of both the history and the current workings of the American university.</p></p><p><p>The first scholarly edition of Thorstein Veblen&#x2019;s classic indictment of the corporate model of American university governance.</p>At the time of its initial publication in 1904, The Higher Learning in America was known in educated circles as the most reflective study ever made of the university system in America. <p> Veblen's evaluation of the misleading notions and erroneous beliefs were inherent in "the higher learning" was received as fair by most academics. As a result, many believed he paved the way to an improved age in college education. </p><p> Just as applicable today as they were decades ago, his sophisticated style remains deprecatingly amusing; his biting critique just as disquieting as it was at the turn of the 19th century. </p><p> The Higher Learning in America remains a penetrating book by one of America's greatest social critics.</p></p><h2>Innovative Methods of Marine Ecosystem Restoration</h2><p><p><strong>Innovative Methods of Marine Ecosystem Restoration</strong> offers a ray of hope in an increasingly gloomy scenario. This book is the first presentation of revolutionary new methods for restoring damaged marine ecosystems. It discusses new techniques for greatly increasing the recruitment, growth, survival, and resistance to stress of marine ecosystems, fisheries, and eroding shorelines, maintaining biodiversity and productivity where it would be lost. The book provides experimental proof that mild electrical stimulation results in increased settlement, increased growth, and reduced mortality for a wide variety of marine organisms, including corals, oysters, sponges, sea-grasses, and salt-marsh grasses. </p> <p></p> <p>In addition to the diversity of ecosystems and geographic regions covered, the contributors from fourteen nations across the globe make this work the first truly global study of marine ecosystem restoration.</p></p><p><p>"As this planet spins ever faster on a collision course with humanity, <strong>Innovative Methods of Marine Ecosystem Restoration</strong> shines positive light on a new direction for coral reef and shoreline restoration. It is a welcome addition to the literature. The volume takes us through 11 case studies first presented at the World Conference on Ecological Restoration in Me�rida, Mexico, in August 2011. It reports on methods for enhancing shorelines and restoring corals reefs, oyster beds, sea grass beds, and salt marshes. ... This volume challenges the common mantra of coral reef conservation that managing coral reefs is really managing people, not reefs. Goreau and Trench take us into a world of technology that amplifies biology and initiates ecological self-restoration using low voltage electrical current through metal frames to enhance the skeletal growth of reef corals and other calcifying organisms. ... The case studies are impressive demonstrations suggesting that electrified iron frames can be used to restore beaches, generate beautiful reefs, and grow more oysters."<br><em>&#x2015;</em>Phillip Dustan, College of Charleston, South Carolina,&nbsp;in <em>The Quarterly Review of Biology,</em> Volume 90</p> <p>"This excellent work deals with ways mild electrical stimulation can enhance settlement and growth and reduce the mortality of such marine organisms as corals, oysters, and sponges as well as sea grasses and salt marshes in temperate and tropical ecosystems. Each chapter is formatted like a brief scientific manuscript, with an introduction and materials/methods, results, discussion, references, and acknowledgments sections. ... In addition to the content the volume's 19 chapters provide, a companion CD contains all the photographs and graphs from the book along with presentations from two international ecosystem restoration conferences.

Time Out Chicago 'Drawing on his meticulous research, Timothy Messer-Kruse raises provocative questions about a momentous event that scholars thought we understood.

The Trial of the Haymarket Anarchists challenges us to set aside preconceptions, read sources carefully, and challenge prevailing assumptions. How do we reconcile conflicting points of view, and how do we place the minutiae of courtroom records in broader context? Messer-Kruse offers persuasive insights into how various actors in the Haymarket violence saw themselves, and what it all meant for labor, politics, and ideology in industrializing America.' Rebecca Edwards, Vassar College, author of New Spirits: Americans in the 'Gilded Age,' 1865-1905</p> <p>'Timothy Messer-Kruse's study extends earlier challenges by Paul Avrich to the generally iconic treatment of the Haymarket 'martyrs' and their martyrdom. It explicitly and directly explodes assumptions about the anarchists in the labor movement and their alleged innocence in the use of dynamite.

Forms and Functions of exchange in archaic Societies</h2><p><p><strong>Since its first publication in English in 1954, <em>The Gift</em>, Marcel Mauss's groundbreaking study of the relation between forms of exchange and social structure, has been acclaimed as a classic among anthropology texts.</strong></p><p>A brilliant example of the comparative method,&nbsp;<em>?The Gift</em>? presents the first systematic study of the custom&#x2015;widespread in primitive societies from ancient Rome to present-day Melanesia&#x2015;of exchanging gifts. The gift is a perfect example of what Mauss calls a total social phenomenon, since it involves legal, economic, moral, religious, aesthetic, and other dimensions. He sees the gift exchange as related to individuals and groups as much as to the objects themselves, and his analysis calls into question the social conventions and economic systems that had been taken for granted for so many years. In a modern translation, introduced by distinguished anthropologist Mary Douglas,&nbsp;<em>?The Gift&nbsp;</em>?is essential reading for students of social anthropology and sociology.</p></p><p>Marcel Mauss was a French sociologist and anthropologist. His work profoundly influenced the field of anthropology with respect to topics such as magic, sacrifice, and gift exchange in primitive cultures.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Black Hole: How an Idea Abandoned by Newtonians, Hated by Einstein, and Gambled On by Hawking Became Loved</h2><p><b>The contentious history of the idea of the black hole&#x2014;the most fascinating and bizarre celestial object in the heavens</b><br><br> For more than half a century, physicists and astronomers engaged in heated dispute over the possibility of black holes in the universe. The weirdly alien notion of a space-time abyss from which nothing escapes&#x2014;not even light&#x2014;seemed to confound all logic. This engrossing book tells the story of the fierce black hole debates and the contributions of Einstein and Hawking and other leading thinkers who completely altered our view of the universe.<br><br> Renowned science writer Marcia Bartusiak shows how the black hole helped revive Einstein&#x2019;s greatest achievement, the general theory of relativity, after decades during which it had been pushed into the shadows. Not until astronomers discovered such surprising new phenomena as neutron stars and black holes did the once-sedate universe transform into an Einsteinian cosmos, filled with sources of titanic energy that can be understood only in the light of relativity. This book celebrates the hundredth anniversary of general relativity, uncovers how the black hole really got its name, and recounts the scientists&#x2019; frustrating, exhilarating, and at times humorous battles over the acceptance of one of history&#x2019;s most dazzling ideas.</p><p><b>Marcia Bartusiak</b> is Professor of the Practice, Graduate Program in Science Writing, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the award-winning author of five previous books, including most recently <i>The Day We Found the Universe</i><i>.</i> She lives in Sudbury, MA.&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need an advanced degree to enjoy this entertaining tale of how black holes meandered their way from theoretical oddity into everyday consciousness. . . .

Houses need strong foundations. Races are won by strong starts just as much as fast finishes. The beginning of your Christian life is no different.

Will you be ready?<i> How to Begin the Christian Life</i> is a modern classic. With more than 600,000 copies in print it has already helped tens of thousands begin their Christian lives.

Are you interested in God's principles for giving financially to the church? This little handbook will give you reliable scriptural guidance in these and other areas of Christian living.</p><p><b>DR. GEORGE SWEETING</b> is the former president and chancellor of the Moody Bible Institute (1971-1999) and is currently Chancellor Emeritus. As a world-renowned evangelist, pastor, teacher, and writer, few are better equipped to explain how to grow in your salvation. <i>How to Begin the Christian Life</i> is a modern classic with more than a million copies in print in English and other languages.As a newborn baby is cared for in the physical world, you need to be helped spiritually. Let me list four helpful suggestions that I will enlarge upon in later chapters.<p><br><br>1. Read the Bible systematically. What food is to the body, the Bible is your new spiritual life. At a prescribed time, in a quiet place, each day should start with the Bible. This is a must if you are to grow in the things of God. The gospel of John is a good place for you to begin. Remember, at least a chapter a day! D.L. Moody said, "The Bible will keep you from sin or sin will keep you from Bible." A chapter a day will certainly help to keep sin away.</p><p><br><br>2. Learn to pray. Prayer is the communion of the believer with God; we speak to God, but He also speaks to us. Prayer is not merely asking favors of God but, rather, waiting in quietness before Him. Pray for personal cleansing and victory over evil: pray for yourself and pray for others.</p><p><br><br>3. Use every opportunity to confess Christ before the world. In a winsome way, immediately tell someone of your spiritual decision. Activity strengthens. When believers share with others, they develop an appetite for Bible study. The result of their speaking to others of their new life will provide daily, up-to-date subjects for prayer. When a new Christian begins working, everything comes into proper focus. R. A. Torrey said, "The more you make of Jesus Christ, the more he will make of you. It will save you from many temptations if the fact is clearly known that you are one who acknowledges Christ as Lord of all things."</p><p><br><br>4. Become part of a local church. If a mother permits her children to grow up in idleness, the result will be unprepared children. Since the Christian's responsibilities toward other believers is clear, waiting only forms bad habits. The Bible says, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some" (Hebrew 10:25). Your faithful church attendance will help you in spiritual growth. Find a fellowship that gives full allegiance to Jesus Christ and the Word of God, and become part of it.If you follow these four Bible steps, Christian growth is promised. You will be sure to meet temptations, but you need not yield or fall to them, for God has promised, "He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world" (1 John 4:4). If you do fall, ask for immediate forgiveness. "If we confess our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). if you fall, do not remain defeated, but get up and go on. Perhaps right now you are facing a battle with some attitude or habit; remember that Christ is ready to help you, and He has all power in heaven and earth. Another secret of successful Christian living is to keep your eyes on Christ. The best of Christians will fail you, but never forget - "Jesus never fails." Congratulations on your decision to receive Jesus Christ as your Savior. Now strive to follow these first steps. Starting right is a key tp spiritual growth.</p></p><h2>Spies, Informers and the &#39;Anti-Sinn Fein Society&#39;: The Intelligence War in Cork City, 1919-1921</h2><p>The book is a study of the shooting of suspected civilian informers by the Cork city IRA in 1920-1921. During a one-year period, at least twenty-four Cork civilians died at the hands of the IRA, including a two-week span that saw eight civilians shot. IRA sources claim some of the civilians were members of an Anti-Sinn Fein Society, a pro-British intelligence network operating in the city. The book analyses the existence of such a network, alleged IRA persecution of ex-soldiers, and the strength of the IRA intelligence efforts in Cork city. It places these trends in the context of both the British reprisal campaign in Cork city, and the IRA&#39;s guerrilla struggle. The book contains significant original research that focuses on events in Cork city in 1920-1921. Chapters on the British reprisal campaign, the IRA intelligence network, and the trends of the conflict provide unique evidence and conclusions regarding the situation in Cork city, which have not been published in any other work and directly contradicts some conclusions made in Peter Hart&#39;s The IRA and its Enemies.</p><p></p><h2>Psychology with Updates on DSM-5</h2><p><br><br><p>David Myers&#x2019; bestselling Psychology has reached a wider audience of students and instructors with each new edition.

Compact Edition 2005</h2><p>This Dictionary has been undertaken to supply a want long felt by the student, f a complete and at the same time cheap Sanskrit-English Dictionary. Very little need, I think, be said with regard to the necessity of bringing out a work like this, when the study of Sanskrit has received such a strong impetus during the last twenty five years. There have been four or five Sanskrit-English Dictionaries published till now; but very few of them fulfill the two essential conditions of the popularity and usefulness of such works: satisfying all the requirements of students and at the same time being within their easy reach. The Dictionaries of Professors Wilson and Monier Williams are very useful and valuable works, but their prices-particularly of the latter-are prohibitively high, and they do not also meet many of the most ordinary wants of Sanskrit readers. A student, while reading Sanskrit at School or College, generally expects that the Dictionary which he uses will give will give appropriate equivalents for such words and compound expressions as may have peculiar meanings or shades of meaning in particular passages.</p><p></p><h2>Philosophy of Language (Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics)</h2><p>This unique textbook introduces linguists to key issues in the philosophy of language. Accessible to students who have taken only a single course in linguistics, yet sophisticated enough to be used at the graduate level, the book provides an overview of the central issues in philosophy of language, a key topic in educating the next generation of researchers in semantics and pragmatics. Thoroughly grounded in contemporary linguistic theory, the book focus on the core foundational and philosophical issues in semantics and pragmatics, richly illustrated with historical case studies to show how linguistic questions are related to philosophical problems in areas such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Students are introduced in Part I to the issues at the core of semantics, including compositionality, reference and intentionality. Part II looks at pragmatics: context, conversational update, implicature and speech acts; whilst Part III discusses foundational questions about meaning. The book will encourage future collaboration and development between philosophy of language and linguistics.</p><p>Aimed at both students and professionals of linguistics who seek a deeper understanding of philosophy of language, as well as philosophers who wish to connect their debates with the practice of linguistics, this book will serve the ever increasing number of courses on philosophy of language for linguistics students.Zolt�n Gendler Szab� is Professor of Philosophy and Linguistics at Yale University, Connecticut.

The organization of the 26 chapters is simple and coherent. Chapter One introduces foundational principles; the remaining 25 chapters are divided into six sections that discuss family law regulation of the formation, continuation, and dissolution of horizontal (spousal) and vertical (parent-child) family relationships. Each subchapter includes cases, statutes, short notes (emphasizing the variations among state laws, historical context and conceptual grounding for the family law doctrines), problems, and a review of multiple perspectives that have influenced the development of the relevant family law doctrines, rules and policies.</p><p></p><h2>The Rediscovery of the Wild (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A compelling case for connecting with the wild, for our psychological and physical well-being and to flourish as a species</b></p><p>We often enjoy the benefits of connecting with nearby, domesticated nature&#x2015;a city park, a backyard garden. But this book makes the provocative case for the necessity of connecting with wild nature&#x2015;untamed, unmanaged, not encompassed, self-organizing, and unencumbered and unmediated by technological artifice. We can love the wild. We can fear it. We are strengthened and nurtured by it. As a species, we came of age in a natural world far wilder than today's, and much of the need for wildness still exists within us, body and mind. <i>The Rediscovery of the Wild</i> considers ways to engage with the wild, protect it, and recover it&#x2015;for our psychological and physical well-being and to flourish as a species.</p><p>The contributors offer a range of perspectives on the wild, discussing such topics as the evolutionary underpinnings of our need for the wild; the wild within, including the primal passions of sexuality and aggression; birding as a portal to wildness; children's fascination with wild animals; wildness and psychological healing; the shifting baseline of what we consider wild; and the true work of conservation.</p></p><p>Peter H.

He explains that in starting the company, its founder and CEO, Fred Smith, created the next-day package delivery industry. We learn why the company has attracted so much attention from the business community and what have been its successes and failures and the 11 abiding principles that guide the company. The author's theory is that following these principles can help managers in any company and in any industry. The review of each management principle and how it has contributed to the company's success concludes with a checklist of questions designed to help managers judge how their companies stack up against the FedEx standards. <i>Mary Whaley</i>Perhaps because he is the first "Federal Express Professor of Excellence" at the University of Memphis, author Wetherbe has written a paean to FedEx founder Fred Smith rather than an analytical evaluation of the history and development of the company. The management "principles" he cites include such home-spun ideas as "everybody pitches in" and "problems have silver linings, too." Wetherbe is convinced that FedEx is a terrific company and that the success it has achieved since its founding over 20 years ago is due to the company's culture.

But with the voyages of Captain James Cook, global attention turned to the Pacific, and European and American dreams of scientific exploration, trade, and empire grew dramatically. By the time of the California gold rush, the Pacific's many shores were fully integrated into world markets-and world consciousness.<br><br><em>The Great Ocean</em> draws on hundreds of documented voyages--some painstakingly recorded by participants, some only known by archeological remains or indigenous memory--as a window into the commercial, cultural, and ecological upheavals following Cook's exploits, focusing in particular on the eastern Pacific in the decades between the 1770s and the 1840s. Beginning with the expansion of trade as seen via the travels of William Shaler, captain of the American Brig <em>Lelia Byrd</em>, historian David Igler uncovers a world where voyagers, traders, hunters, and native peoples met one another in episodes often marked by violence and tragedy. Igler describes how indigenous communities struggled against introduced diseases that cut through the heart of their communities; how the ordeal of Russian Timofei Tarakanov typified the common practice of taking hostages and prisoners; how Mary Brewster witnessed first-hand the bloody "great hunt" that decimated otters, seals, and whales; how Adelbert von Chamisso scoured the region, carefully compiling his notes on natural history; and how James Dwight Dana rivaled Charles Darwin in his pursuit of knowledge on a global scale.<br><br>These stories--and the historical themes that tie them together--offer a fresh perspective on the oceanic worlds of the eastern Pacific. Ambitious and broadly conceived, <em>The Great Ocean</em> is the first book to weave together American, oceanic, and world history in a path-breaking portrait of the Pacific world.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Igler </strong>is Associate Professor of History at the University of California, Irvine. His books include <em>Industrial Cowboys: Miller &amp; Lux and the Transformation of the Far West, 1850-1920</em> and <em>The Human Tradition in California. </em><br><br>"Among the numerous accomplishments of this impressive book, the most striking may be its achievement of extending history from its usual terrestrial focus to the ocean. David Igler's <em>The Great Ocean</em> joins a growing list of histories of ocean basins and world histories that focus on the maritime realm...Igler's contribution not only puts the sea at the center, but succeeds in telling a story that illuminates both human history and the history of a part of the ocean, the waterscape between the coastal Americas and islands scattered throughout the Pacific."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"The Great Ocean pictures the mid nineteenth-century Pacific as both a graveyard and a seedbed...Tell[s] a grim story of unbridled hubris, confident consumption, environmental degradation and the collapse of vulnerable populations."--<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"A signal contribution to the growing body of seminal studies on North America's Pacific ties...Igler's book brilliantly elucidates the complex interplay between global, oceanic, and local scales of history....The author's thesis is bold and breaks new ground; his scholarship is impeccable; and his exposition is clear, succinct, and at times evocative.

Its scale is grand, embracing waters and lands, humans and animals, and the imperial Pacific while not losing sight of the individuals who negotiated that history-a remarkable achievement."--Gary Okihiro, author of <em>Island Worlds: A History of Hawai`i and the United States</em><p></p><br>"Here is U.S. history, maritime history, Pacific Islands history, world history, environmental history, labor history, social history all in one volume, and all beautifully done. A host of topics--early encounters in the Hawaiian Islands, the economic significance of whaling, the differences and similarities in how various powers established their presences in the Pacific, and more--look different once Igler is done with them. Surprises abound, but so does careful, balanced synthesis. What more could a reader want?"--Kenneth Pomeranz, University of Chicago<p></p><br>"David Igler's <em>The Great Ocean</em> is a majestic contribution to the globalizing of American history, and an original, environmentally-informed peregrination around North and South America, Oceania, and Asia. Igler follows traders and merchants, epidemic plagues, the slaughter and near decimation of marine mammals, captives and hostages, and the nineteenth-century articulation of a truly Pacific-based natural history of geology, oceanography, climatology, and American empire. It is an allusive work, engaging, richly detailed, and full of compelling stories that change our understanding of life across generations, in and around the world's greatest ocean."--Matt K.

Then a series of unusual events reignites Ethan&#39;s ambition, and he is pitched on to a bold course, where all scruples are put aside.

In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without a degree. During the next five years, he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City and then as a caretaker for a Lake Tahoe estate, all the time working on his first novel, <i>Cup of Gold</i> (1929). After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California fictions, <i>The Pastures of Heaven</i> (1932) and <i>To a God Unknown</i> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <i>The Long Valley</i> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <i>Tortilla Flat</i> (1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s <i>paisanos</i>. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. The powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <i>In Dubious Battle</i> (1936), <i>Of Mice and Men</i> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> (1939). Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <i>The Forgotten Village</i> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <i>Sea of Cortez</i> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing <i>Bombs Away</i> (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <i>The Moon Is Down</i> (1942). <i>Cannery Row</i> (1945); <i>The Wayward Bus</i> (1947); <i>The Pearl</i> (1947); <i>A Russian Journal</i> (1948); another experimental drama, <i>Burning Bright</i> (1950); and <i>The Log from the &#x201c;Sea of Cortez&#x201d;</i> (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <i>East of Eden</i> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history. The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <i>Sweet Thursday</i> (1954), <i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i> (1957), <i>Once There Was a War</i> (1958), <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> (1961), <i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i> (1962), <i>America and Americans</i> (1966), and the posthumously published <i>Journal of a Novel: The &#x201c;East of Eden&#x201d; Letters</i> (1969), <i>Viva Zapata!</i> (1975), <i>The</i> <i>Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i> (1976), and <i>Working Days: The Journals of &#x201c;The Grapes of Wrath&#x201d;</i> (1989). He died in 1968, having won a Nobel Prize in 1962.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>SUSAN SHILLINGLAW is a professor of English at San Jose State University and scholar-in-residence at the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas.

On the eve of the ceremony, the <i>New York Times</i> published an editorial by Arthur Mizener questioning the wisdom of the Swedish Academy&#x2019;s decision: &#x201c;Does a Moral Vision of the Thirties Deserve a Nobel Prize?&#x201d; The article seared Steinbeck&#x2019;s soul, no doubt, and placed once again before his American readers the enigma of his reputation. How to define this most American of writers, the engaged artist of 1930s California? And how to describe this last novel, certainly not a howl of social protest in the vein of his 1939 classic, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, but neither the twilight reflections of an aging writer. For many readers <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> is a dark morality tale about the fall of a blue-blooded American hero, Ethan Allen Hawley, who succumbs to the temptations of wealth, power, and prestige. But this final novel defies categories. If it&#x2019;s a parable of corruption and redemption, as Steinbeck suggests in his epigraph, it&#x2019;s also a lesson in Darwinian survival. The novel insists on a symbolic and highly ironic framework&#x2014;the first half takes place on Easter weekend in April 1960 and the second on the Fourth of July weekend that same year. Yet the book is also realistic, set in Steinbeck&#x2019;s own Sag Harbor, New York&#x2014;New Baytown in the novel&#x2014;and influenced by the moral quagmires of contemporary America. And while the work tips its hat to Steinbeck&#x2019;s love of the Arthurian saga, with Ethan a latter-day Lancelot, it&#x2019;s also true that Ethan&#x2019;s voice seems almost postmodern, speaking a language that is highly wrought, artificial, self-reflective. <i>The Winterof Our Discontent</i> is, seemingly, a patchwork of intentions, all meant to shake a reader&#x2019;s complacency.</p><p>Since its publication in April 1961, this &#x201c;curious&#x201d; novel has baffled many readers. Carlos Baker&#x2019;s review for the <i>New York Times</i> sounds a characteristic note of dissatisfaction:</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>This is a problem novel whose central problem is never fully solved, an internal conflict novel in which the central issue between nobility and expediency, while it is joined, is never satisfactorily resolved. For this reason, despite its obvious powers, <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> cannot rightly stand in the forefront of Steinbeck&#x2019;s fiction.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>Far from being the source of the novel&#x2019;s creative failure, its irresolution and allusiveness are, in fact, central to its meaning. &#x201c;If this is a time of confusion,&#x201d; Steinbeck had written a few years earlier, &#x201c;might it be best to set that down?&#x201d; That was his challenge in <i>The Winter of Our Discontent.</i> Ambiguous threads and ethical knots are woven into each page of the narrative&#x2014;and apparent in the first pages, starting with the perplexities of Ethan&#x2019;s ancestral heritage, part pirate, part Puritan, and his own name, Ethan Allen, both a Revolutionary War patriot and a man charged with treason. After two chapters in each section of the novel&#x2019;s two sections, point of view switches from third to first person.<p></p><p>Indeed, the text&#x2019;s evasive strategies and perplexing characters suggest Steinbeck&#x2019;s profound unease with Cold War America, where his real fear for his country centered not on Sputnik and Russian armament but on &#x201c;a creeping, all-pervading, nerve-gas of immorality which starts in the nursery and does not stop before it reaches the highest offices, both corporate and governmental.&#x201d; Steinbeck sent that observation to his close friend, politician Adlai Stevenson, in November 1959, and the letter was subsequently published in <i>Newsday,</i> sparking a national discussion: The question &#x201c;Are We Morally Flabby?&#x201d; was debated by four educators and writers in a February 1960 issue of the <i>New Republic,</i> and the next month <i>Newsday</i> published &#x201c;Steinbeck Replies.&#x201d; Steinbeck&#x2019;s answer was a resounding yes, and more than anything else <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> explores the contours of that affirmative response. From 1960, when he composed this novel, to the end of his life eight years later, Steinbeck stood as America&#x2019;s moral compass, pointing to Americans&#x2019; virtues and lapses in three unflinching books: <i>The Winter of Our Discontent, Travels with Charley</i> (1962), and <i>America and Americans</i> (1966).</p><p>The freedom to critique one&#x2019;s country, he felt with increasing urgency, was the role of the artist in a free nation. Trips to the Soviet Union in 1937, 1947, and 1963 as well as charges made by Communist writers that he had moved politically to the right crystallized his independent stance&#x2014;Steinbeck&#x2019;s Cold War was a &#x201c;Duel Without Pistols&#x201d; (a 1952 article he wrote in Italy after being attacked in a Communist newspaper for not objecting to the &#x201c;degeneracy and brutality of American soldiers&#x201d; in Korea). While American citizens and artists could voice opinions freely, he wrote, Communist artists were constrained by orthodoxy. Speak as an American critic he would, to the end of his days. That defiant patriotism informs <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i>. In effect, Ethan Allen Hawley, his central character, asserts his own freedom to speak out and, in the process, replaces a hollow self with a more authentic self, however morally imperiled. What makes it such a quirky and important book is that it suggests, through Ethan&#x2019;s voice, the simmering discontent of its time, the cacophony and dislocation of Cold War America, overtly a superpower, internally super powerless.</p><p>I. UNDERSTANDING JOHN <b>STEINBECK&#x2019;S DISCONTENT</b> </p><p><i>&#x201c;A novel may be said to be the man who writes it.&#x201d;</i> <br>( John Steinbeck to Elizabeth Otis and Chase Horton, April 1957)</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>With a particular man in mind, Thomas Malory, John Steinbeck wrote this in 1957, one year into his three-year investigation of this fifteenth-century author of <i>Le Morte d&#x2019;Arthur,</i> his era, Arthur&#x2019;s Camelot, and Middle English manuscripts. Such layered understanding was essential, he thought, before attempting his own translation of Malory&#x2019;s <i>Arthur</i> into modern English. But the same sentence might be written about Steinbeck himself: <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> is the restless man who wrote it. A decade-long winter of discontent is, in several senses, his own. And the project he put aside in the fall of 1959, his modern translation of Malory, informs the background of his final novel.<p></p><p>Steinbeck&#x2019;s discontent, however, was artistic and cultural, not personal. The year 1950 was a watershed; he moved permanently from California, his birthplace, to New York City in December 1949, and a year later he married his third wife, Elaine Scott. This marriage gave him far more stability than the first two&#x2014;certainty of love shared with a self-confident woman. Once an assistant stage manager on Broadway (for <i>Oklahoma!</i> when it opened), Elaine stepped into her new marriage with style, energy, wit, and steady love. For their eighteen years of marriage, she kept much of the world at bay. Some qualities of Steinbeck&#x2019;s happy marriage to Elaine make their way into <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i>&#x2014;certainly the solidity of the union (this is, in fact, the only Steinbeck book that opens with a bedroom scene). Ethan&#x2019;s rather cloying nicknames for Mary are close to Steinbeck&#x2019;s own for his beloved Elaine, who was &#x201c;<i>moglie</i>&#x201d; when they traveled and &#x201c;Lily Maid&#x201d; at home. Most important, the steady light that Mary casts for Ethan is Elaine&#x2019;s for John: &#x201c;No one in the world can rise to a party or a plateau of celebration like my Mary,&#x201d; Ethan muses. &#x201c;With Mary in the doorway of a party everyone feels more attractive and clever than he was, and so he actually becomes.&#x201d; The marriage of Ethan and Mary is Steinbeck&#x2019;s most fully drawn portrait of marriage and home life&#x2014;at least in part an index of his own contentment.</p><p>With an equal sense of renewal, this displaced Californian embraced his and Elaine&#x2019;s new home, New York City, and made it his own: &#x201c;As far as homes go,&#x201d; he wrote in a 1953 essay, &#x201c;Autobiography: Making of a New Yorker,&#x201d; &#x201c;there is only a small California town and New York. . . . All of everything is concentrated here, population, theater, art, writing, publishing, importing, business, murder, mugging, luxury, poverty. It is all of everything. It goes all night. It is tireless and its air is charged with energy.

Since <b><i>The New Teacher Book</i></b> first came out in 2004, it has become an invaluable resource for new teachers entering the classroom. <br> This expanded collection of writings and reflections - some by new teachers, others by veterans with decades of experience to share - offers practical guidance on how to effectively navigate the school system, form rewarding professional relationships with colleagues, and connect in meaningful ways with students and families from all cultures and backgrounds. <br> <b><i>The New Teacher Book</i></b> will help new teachers, from kindergarten through high school, sustain the passion and ideals that led them to teaching, and channel that energy into the day-to-day reality of working in a school.</p><p>Just when new teachers might feel that it's time to throw in the towel, <i>The New Teacher Book</i> makes its appearance with stimulating stories, ideas, and encouragement that remind teachers why they entered the profession in the first place. Grounded in a deep respect for teachers, the articles, ideas, and resources will inspire and motivate all educators, not just those new to the profession. By questioning the stale prescriptions and taken-for-granted practices so common in education today, this book sends a powerful message that education is above all about social justice.<br> --Sonia Nieto, professor emerita, University of Massachusetts Amherst<br><br>An indispensable resource for new teachers has only become better!

Yet he is keenly aware that the actual past remains fundamentally irreplicable. All histories are culturally crafted artifacts, commensurate with folk tales, stage plays, or films. Whether derived from logbooks and letters, or displayed on music hall stages and Hollywood back lots, history is in essence our making sense of what has and continues to happen, creating for us a sense of our cultural and individual selves.<br> <br> Through juxtapositions of actual events and creative reenactments of them&#x2014;such as the mutiny on the <i>Bounty</i> in 1787 and the various Hollywood films that depict that event&#x2014;Dening calls attention to the provocative moment of theatricality in history making where histories, cultures, and selves converge. Moving adeptly across varied terrains, from the frontiers of North America to the islands of the South Pacific, Dening marshals a striking array of diverse, often recalcitrant, sources to examine the tangled histories of cross-cultural clash and engagement. Refusing to portray conquest, colonization, and hegemony simply as abstract processes, Dening, in his own culturally reflexive performance, painstakingly evokes the flesh and form of past actors, both celebrated and unsung, whose foregone lives have become our history.<br> <br></p></p><p>This book is both more personal and more panoramic than Dening&#39;s other books. No one reflects so spiritedly on history and anthropology in and as each other. His gripping essays show Polynesians and Europeans being processed and mangled into theatrical meanings, past and present.Greg Dening is Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Melbourne.

Marge, who received Bachelor's and Master's degrees from California State University at Sacramento, was affiliated with American River College. An avid reader and traveler, her travel experiences often found their way into her books as applications, exercise sets, and feature sets. Her interest in archeology led to trips to various digs and ruin sites, producing some fascinating problems for her textbooks involving such topics as the building of Mayan pyramids and the acoustics of ancient ball courts in the Yucatan.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When <b>John Hornsby</b> enrolled as an undergraduate at Louisiana State University, he was uncertain whether he wanted to study mathematics education or journalism. His ultimate decision was to become a teacher, but after twenty-five years of teaching at the high school and university levels and fifteen years of writing mathematics textbooks, both of his goals have been realized. His love for both teaching and for mathematics is evident in his passion for working with students and fellow teachers as well. His specific professional interests are recreational mathematics, mathematics history, and incorporating graphing calculators into the curriculum. John's personal life is busy as he devotes time to his family (wife Gwen, and sons Chris, Jack, and Josh), and has been an avid baseball fan all of his life. John's other hobbies include numismatics (the study of coins) and record collecting. He loves the music of the 1960s and has an extensive collection of the recorded works of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A native Midwesterner,<b> Terry McGinnis</b> received her Bachelor&#x2019;s of Science in Elementary Education with a concentration in Mathematics from Iowa State University. She has taught elementary and middle school mathematics, and developed and implemented the curriculum used with her students. Terry has been involved in college mathematics publishing for over 20 years, working with a variety of authors on textbooks in both developmental mathematics and precalculus. After working behind the scenes on many of the Lial/Hornsby textbooks and supplements for over 10 years, Terry joined Margaret Lial and John Hornsby in 2002 as coauthor of their developmental mathematics series. When not working, Terry enjoys spinning at a local health club, walking, and reading fiction. She is the devoted mother of two sons, Andrew and Tyler.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Callie Daniels </b>has always had a passion for learning mathematics and brings that passion into the classroom with her students. She attended the University of the Ozarks where she earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in Secondary Mathematics Education. She has two master&#x2019;s degrees: one in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Missouri&#x2014;Rolla, the second in Adult Education from the University of Missouri&#x2014;St. Louis. Her professional interests include improving success in the community college mathematics sequence, using technology to enhance students&#x2019; understanding of mathematics, and creating materials that support classroom teaching and student understanding. She is able to pursue these interests as a contributor on the Lial Developmental Math series, and a co-author on the Precalculus series.</p></p><h2>Henry VI, Part 1 (The Pelican Shakespeare)</h2><p><b>The acclaimed Pelican Shakespeare series edited by A.

Authors Laurence Maslon and Michael Kantor draw on countless sources to chronicle the past century of American comedy and the geniuses who created and performed it-melding biography, American history, and a lotta laughs into an exuberant, important book.<br> Each of the six chapters focuses a different style or archetype of comedy, from the slapstick pratfalls of Buster Keaton and Lucille Ball through the wiseguy put-downs of Groucho Marx and Larry David, to the incendiary bombshells of Mae West and Richard Pryor . And at every turn the significance of these comedians-smashing social boundaries, challenging the definition of good taste, speaking the truth to the powerful-is vividly tangible. MAKE 'EM LAUGH is more than a compendium of American comic genius; it is a window onto the way comedy both reflects the world and changes it-one laugh at a time.<br> Starting from the groundbreaking PBS series, the authors have gone deeper into the works and lives of America's great comic artists, with biographical portraits, archival materials, cultural overviews, and rare photos. Brilliantly illustrated, with insights (and jokes) from comedians, writers and producers, along with film, radio, television, and theater historians, MAKE 'EM LAUGH is an indispensible, definitive book about comedy in America.<br></p><p><strong>Michael Kantor </strong>is a writer, director, and producer whose work includes "Quincy Jones: In the Pocket" for <em>American Masters, </em>Cornerstone for HBO, and <em>The West </em> with Ken Burns. Prior to his work in television, Kantor was a freelance theater director and writer, published in <em>Newsday, American Theater</em>, and <em>Interview</em>. He is president of Ghost Light Films and Almo Inc., companies dedicated to bringing the arts to television.<br><br><strong>Laurence Maslon</strong> is an associate arts professor at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. With Michael Kantor, he coauthored two episodes of the <em>Broadway</em> series and served as its senior adviser. He also wrote the <em>American Masters </em>biography of Richard Rodgers and edited the Library of America edition of George S. Kaufman's comedies. He lives in New York City and on the North Fork of Long Island.Kantor, who produced and directed the Emmy-winning <i>Broadway: The American Musical</i> for PBS in 2004, returns with a six-part PBS series on comedy. For this companion book, he teamed with NYU professor Maslon, editor of Library of America's George S. Kaufman collection. Their guide to guffaws and giggles ranges from silent film actors (Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton) to sitcoms (<i>Seinfeld</i>), satire (<i>Mad</i>, <i>SNL</i>) and stand-up comics (George Carlin, Lenny Bruce). Taking a scattershot approach with 60-plus performer profiles and sidebars, the resulting text is sometimes superficial with curious oversights; two decades of radio comedy get squeezed into three pages, so <i>Amos 'n' Andy</i> and <i>Bob and Ray</i> rate only a few paragraphs; Stan Freberg sold millions of records yet is dismissed in a single sentence. With hundreds of fascinating photographs, this book benefits from the TV series' extensive photo research, but what is certain to be a hilarious cascade of clips on PBS is a pratfall in print. <i>(Dec. 2)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

S�nke Johnsen starts with the basics, describing the properties of light and the units and geometry of measurement. He then explores how light is created and propagates and how it interacts with matter, covering topics such as absorption, scattering, fluorescence, and polarization. Johnsen also provides a tutorial on how to measure light as well as an informative discussion of quantum mechanics.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Optics of Life</i> features a host of examples drawn from nature and everyday life, and several appendixes that offer further practical guidance for researchers. This concise book uses a minimum of equations and jargon, explaining the basic physics of light in a succinct and lively manner. It is the essential primer for working biologists and for anyone seeking an accessible introduction to optics.</p></p><p><br><p>"This book provides just about everything one needs to know about biological optics, from the nature of light and its transmission to intensity, color, and polarization properties and their consequences. It is informal yet detailed, and will be easily accessible to anyone interested in biological optics, environmental optics, and animal or human vision. I highly recommend it."<b>--John A.

Moore</b><br> Between 1951 and 1957, a group of young men came to teach at the University of Texas School of Architecture in Austin. These "Texas Rangers," as they later came to be called - Bernhard Hoesli, Colin Rowe, John Hejduk, Robert Slutzky, Lee Hodgden, John Shaw, and Werner Seligmann, among others - created an unprecedented teaching program that challenged the important pedagogies of the time, and that contained in large part the origins and explanations for a postmodern revolution in architecture. Ten years in the making, Alexander Caragonne's lively, fully illustrated story documents one of the most significant chapter in the history of postwar American architectural education.<br> <br> Challenging the anti-intellectual tendencies both of the pragmatic, regionalist American tradition and of the modernist pedagogy inspired by the Bauhaus, the new curriculum proposed that a workable, useful body of architectural theory could be derived from an ongoing critique of significant buildings and projects across history and cultures. Visualization and organization of architectural space was emphasized over the shaping of mass, along with the recognition and development of the architectural idea. Gestalt psychological concepts for evaluating and describing architectural form and space were encouraged, and the value of historical precedent in the design process recognized.<br> <br> Caragonne pulls together the disparate strands of a program - a critique of a mainstream architectural culture and education - that has for many years remained a kind of dimly perceived underground. Figuring largely in his account are the mythical figure of Colin Rowe and Bernhard Hoesli, whose collaboration provided the intellectual basis of the new curriculum. Caragonne, who witnessed the events as an undergraduate in the School of Architecture, describes Rowe's background and his reintroduction of architectural history into the design studio. He also provides a detailed analysis of the teaching program and its subsequent influence on architectural education and thought.</p><p>Alexander Caragonne, AIA, is an architect and writer living in Berkeley, California.&#34;Centered around the charismatic figure of Colin Rowe, an English architect and former student at the University of Liverpool, a critic and theorist of the generation of James Stirling, Colin St. John Wilson, Robert Maxwell, and Alan Colquhoun, The Texas Rangers reconstructs the peculiar conjuncture of high formalism, modernism, revived historicism and regionalism that informed this group, and pieces together the original curriculum they forged. It is a history of critical interest to the subsequent development of architectural teaching, theory, and practice in England and the United States.&#34; - Anthony Vidler, Professor and Chair of the Department of Art History at the University of California, Los Angeles</p><h2>Texas Criminal Law: Principles and Practices</h2><p><p> <i>For undergraduate courses in Texas Criminal Law </i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Criminal Law in the Lone Star State</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Texas Criminal Law: Principles and Practices </i> </b>provides an in-depth review of Texas criminal law while highlighting how Texas legal sanctions differ from other states.

Working at the intersection of art history, archaeology, literature, and aesthetics, he reveals a people fascinated with the power of sculpture to provoke wonder in beholders.&nbsp; Wonder, not accuracy, realism, naturalism or truth, was the supreme objective of Greek sculptors. Neer traces this way of thinking about art from the poems of Homer to the philosophy of Plato. Then, through meticulous accounts of major sculpture from around the Greek world, he shows how the demand for wonder-inducing statues gave rise to some of the greatest masterpieces of Greek art. Rewriting the history of Greek sculpture in Greek terms and restoring wonder to a sometimes dusty subject, <i>The Emergence of the Classical Style in Greek Sculpture </i>is an indispensable guide for anyone interested in the art of sculpture or the history of the ancient world.</p><p><b>Richard Neer</b> is the David B. and Clara E.

Similarly neglected are the larger ideas and aspirations of international diplomacy that gradually emerged from its immediate functions.<br><br>This impressive survey, written by one of our most experienced international historians, and covering the 500 years in which European diplomacy was largely a world to itself, triumphantly fills that gap.<br></p><p><p>'a most interesting and instructive book...

From the author of <em>The Doors of Perception, Island</em>, and countless other works of fiction, non-fiction, philosophy, and poetry, comes this powerful work of speculative fiction that has enthralled and terrified readers for generations. <em>Brave New World</em> remains absolutely relevant to this day as both a cautionary dystopian tale in the vein of the George Orwell classic <em>1984</em>, and as thought-provoking, thoroughly satisfying entertainment. </p></p><p>&#34;Community, Identity, Stability&#34; is the motto of Aldous Huxley&#39;s utopian World State. Here everyone consumes daily grams of soma, to fight depression, babies are born in laboratories, and the most popular form of entertainment is a &#34;Feelie,&#34; a movie that stimulates the senses of sight, hearing, and touch. Though there is no violence and everyone is provided for, Bernard Marx feels something is missing and senses his relationship with a young women has the potential to be much more than the confines of their existence allow. Huxley foreshadowed many of the practices and gadgets we take for granted today--let&#39;s hope the sterility and absence of individuality he predicted aren&#39;t yet to come.<p>The astonishing novel <em>Brave New World</em>, originally published in 1932, presents Aldous Huxley's legendary vision of a world of tomorrow utterly transformed. In Huxley's darkly satiric yet chillingly prescient imagining of a "utopian" future, humans are genetically designed and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively serve a ruling order. A powerful work of speculative fiction that has enthralled and terrified readers for generations, it remains remarkably relevant to this day as both a warning to be heeded and as a thought-provoking yet satisfying entertainment.</p></p><h2>Offshore: Exploring the Worlds of Global Outsourcing</h2><p>Offshore outsourcing- the movement of jobs to lower-wage countries- is one of the defining features of globalization. Routine blue-collar work has been going offshore for decades, but the digital revolution beginning in the 1990s extended this process to many parts of the service economy too. Politically controversial from the beginning, "offshoring" is conventionally seen as a threat to jobs, wages, and economic security in higher-income countries, having become synonymous with the dirty work of globalization. Even though the majority of corporations make some use of offshore outsourcing, fearful of negative publicity most now choose to manage these activities in a discreet manner. Partly as a result, the global sourcing business, reckoned to be worth more than $120 billion, largely operates under the radar, its ocean-spanning activities in low-cost labour arbitrage being poorly documented and poorly understood.<br><br><em>Offshore</em> is the first sustained investigation of the workings of the global sourcing industry, its business practices, its market dynamics, its technologies, and its politics. The book traces the complex transformation of the worlds of global sourcing, from its origins in the new international division of labour in the 1970s, through the rapid growth of back-office economies in India and the Philippines since the 1990s, to the development of "nearshore" markets in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Recently, this evolving process of geographical and organizational restructuring has included experiments in "backshoring" within low-cost, ex-urban locations in the United States and a wave of software-enabled automation, which threatens to remove labour from many back offices altogether. In these and other ways, the offshore revolution continues.<br></p><p><br>Jamie Peck, <em>Canada Research Chair in Urban &amp; Regional Political Economy and Professor of Geography, University of British Columbia</em><br><br>Jamie Peck is Canada Research Chair in Urban &amp; Regional Political Economy and Professor of Geography at the University of British Columbia, Canada.

To ask why is to ask why fire burns. His credo may be stated thus: he has sworn an oath to keep his mushroom patches secret and to find and to poach on the patches of other hunters. When mushrooms are the prize, the scope of all his aspirations is narrowed to these two goals. Though in all else he may be as Saintly as St. Francis, in the pursuit of these ends he is more Satanic than Satan. He will betray his nearest and dearest without the slightest twitch of flesh or spirit. He is amoral."--Definition of a mushroom hunter by Angelo Pellegrini<br><br>This classic field guide answers the amateur mycologist's two most important questions: "What is it?" and "Is it good to eat?" Color photographs illustrate 199 species of mushrooms ranging from boletes to puffballs, chantrelles to truffles. Full descriptions clearly identify the edible or poisonous qualities of each.</p><p><b>Joseph F. Ammirati </b>is professor of biology at the University of Washington and a member of the Toxicology Committee of the North American Mycological Association.The third edition of this field guide (first published as The Savory Wild Mushroom) describes 199 edible, non-edible, and poisonous mushrooms commonly found in the Pacific Northwest, but omits the recipes included in the 1962 and 1971 editions. Grouped by the general types of the fruiting bodies, the entries feature a color photograph, give common and scientific names, describe the mushroom, and remark on its edibility and similarity to other species. The guide includes an up-to-date chapter on mushroom poisons. Beginners will appreciate the well-printed photographs and clear, nontechnical language.

It was later refined in European universities as a legal, historical, and philological discipline, and in the twentieth century it has primarily been applied to medieval and early modern documents in order to evaluate their authority as sources of research.<br><i>Diplomatics</i> embraces the perspective of the modern archivist, and investigates the origin, development, and application of diplomatic concepts. It examines the organizational and evaluative effectiveness of diplomatic concepts in the context of modern records and archival systems, and looks at the relationship between originality and authenticity in records. The physical and intellectual form of records is examined, and the traditional methodology of diplomatic criticism is clearly explained and augmented by tips concerning its archival use.<br><i>Diplomatics</i> was originally a series of six articles that appeared in <i>Archivaria</i>, the journal of the Association of Canadian Archivists.

He describes the year's cycle: the turkey shoot at Christmas, the tapping of maple trees, fishing for bass in the evening, the marshalling of the militia. But Cooper is also concerned with exploring the development of the cultural and philosophical underpinnings of the American experience. He writes of the conflicts within the settlement itself, focusing primarily on the contrast between the natural codes of the hunter and woodsman Natty Bumppo and his Indian friend John Mohegan and the more rigid structure of law needed by a more complex society. Quite possibly America's first best-seller (more than three thousand copies were sold within hours of publication), <i>The Pioneers</i> today evokes a vibrant and authentic picture of the American pioneering experience. <p></p></p><p>From its remarkable first scene--in which a gunshot finds an unintended target--to its fiery climax in the woods of New York State, <i>The Pioneers</i> is a rich chronicle of early frontier life filled with action, adventure, romance, and history. It is also the work that established James Fenimore Cooper as the first great American novelist. The first installment if what would later become the famous Leatherstocking Tales, <i>The Pioneers</i> introduces readers to the colorful and enduring character of frontiersman Natty Bumppo. Forced by a local landowner to obey new hunting laws, Natty Bumppo rebels and finds allies in the landowner's daughter and a mysterious young stranger. Against the backdrop of the changing seasons, a varied cast of unforgettable characters is caught up in a drama that illuminates the essence of the American character and the conflict between a restlessly expanding society and the unspoiled wilderness that was here before us all.Originally published in 1823, the novel is the first of Cooper&#39;s five Leatherstocking Tales and the one that incorporates most fully his own experience of growing up in a town on the American frontier. He provides brilliant pictures of village life, from Christmas dinner and a turkey shoot, to church and tavern, deer hunt and forest fire, and village courtship and courtroom drama. The heart of the novel is a conflict over who owns America, and by what concept of right.</p><h2>Amy Cutler</h2><p>Amy Cutler's exquisitely detailed scenes of women, animals and hybrid beings engaged in otherworldly drama lure the viewer into an enigmatic realm populated by figures with elongated noses, tea-kettle heads or broomstick arms, some wearing altered hoop skirts. She takes inspiration from stories and images encountered in the media, and then mixes them up with Persian miniatures, army survival guides, nineteenth century illustrations, folktales and personal experiences. Her works, which include gouache on paper, paint on wood panel, and drawing, have been described as "snippets of Laura Ingalls Wilder, Hieronymus Bosch and <i>Masterpiece Theatre</i>." Her scenarios are often funny and just as often uneasy--for instance, despite or because of the loving care they give, one group of her women subjects watch as their snowmen-companions melt away. This is the first book on the work of this young Brooklyn-based artist.</p><p><b>Amy Cutler</b> was born in 1974 in Poughkeepsie, New York, and lives and works in Brooklyn. Her work has appeared at the Brooklyn Museum, P.S.1 and the Drawing Center, and in the Whitney Biennial. It is in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New Museum, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, all in New York, among others.</p><h2>Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics</h2><p>This one-stop reference book on the vital relationship between Scripture and ethics offers needed orientation and perspective for students, pastors, and scholars. Written to respond to the movement among biblical scholars and ethicists to recover the Bible for moral formation, it is the best reference work available on the intersection of these two fields. The volume shows how Christian Scripture and Christian ethics are necessarily intertwined and offers up-to-date treatment of five hundred biblical, traditional, and contemporary topics, ranging from adultery, bioethics, and Colossians to vegetarianism, work, and Zephaniah. The stellar ecumenical list of contributors consists of more than two hundred leading scholars from the fields of biblical studies and ethics, including Darrell Bock, David Gushee, Amy Laura Hall, Daniel Harrington, Dennis Olson, Christine Pohl, Glen Stassen, and Max Stackhouse.</p><p>"The <i>Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics</i> is a unique reference work, drawing together topics that are intimately connected but often relegated to separate spheres. Letting both spheres identify the topics, the editors have compiled a comprehensive handbook for thinking about the realm of ethics and the moral life but with particular attention to what the Bible has to say about such matters. At the same time, new directions are opened up as biblical texts and topics not often associated with ethical issues are seen to have much to say. Scholars in both fields will want to have this volume in their library."<br>--<b>Patrick D. Miller</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"A book as ambitious as the <i>Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics</i> risks being too superficial to be helpful. I am happy to report that this is not the case for this imaginatively conceived and organized book. This book will quickly become an indispensable resource for Christian reflection on the moral life."<br>--<b>Stanley Hauerwas</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"The dictionary provides a wonderful tool for exploring the relationship between Scripture and ethics. Essays providing an overview of the moral concerns of Scripture and the shape of Christian ethics usefully frame an array of detailed articles. Some articles treat biblical books, others ethical topics, including virtues and vices, denominational traditions, contemporary topics such as environmental ethics, and controversial subjects such as homosexuality. The treatments are comprehensive and honest, informed by critical perspectives on the Bible and contemporary ethical reflection. They do not shy away from issues where churches, by their own admission, have misused Scripture (e.g., "apartheid"). This volume is a rich resource for biblical scholars and ethicists alike."<br>--<b>Harold W. Attridge</b>, Yale Divinity School<br><br>"The relationship of biblical studies to moral theology has not been given the attention it merits by biblical scholars. This impressive volume has pulled together important articles on a wide range of topics that will certainly be of importance to systematic and moral theologians. The selection of topics is broadly ecumenical and should appeal to the widest possible audience. Let us hope that this volume will spur a new generation of studies to reflect more carefully and systematically on the moral teachings and legacy of the Bible."<br>--<b>Gary A. Anderson</b>, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"It is rare indeed for a dictionary to be a page-turner, but this one makes the reader want to find a comfortable chair and a lot of free time to roam through it. The scope of the articles is remarkable as is the quality of the research and writing. If any single volume can help us draw well-informed connections between the thought-world of Scripture and the contemporary contexts in which we teach, preach, and seek to live as people of faith, this may be it."<br>--<b>Ellen F. Davis</b>, Duke Divinity School"Renewed interest in the relationship between Scripture and ethics has created the need for an accessible and reliable guide to the issues and the literature. This is it."<br>--<b>R. W. L. Moberly</b>, Durham University<br><br>"Pastors, laypeople, and scholars alike will find in this exceptionally valuable resource wise guidance for Christian life and discernment about ethical issues. It offers an excellent blend of substantive engagement and methodological reflection from well-respected scholars. Highly recommended."<br>--<b>L. Gregory Jones</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"Scholars in the fields of Scripture and ethics are increasingly engaged in important conversations, and this volume is an excellent contribution to that dialogue. This star-studded grouping of contributors from biblical, ethical, and theological disciplines covers a remarkable range of pertinent topics, including every biblical book and every lively ethical topic. This invaluable reference tool will serve both lay readers and scholars very well indeed and contribute to the continuing interaction among them in thoughtful and provocative ways."<br>--<b>Terence E. Fretheim</b>, Luther Seminary<br><br>"Wide-ranging, thorough, and cautious, the <i>Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics</i> will be a helpful resource for both students and scholars. With its mix of different kinds of articles and its attention throughout to biblical materials, the dictionary meets a significant need and provides something for almost any reader."<br>--<b>Gilbert Meilaender</b>, Valparaiso University<br><br>"This is a wellspring of wisdom that will prove to be of immense value to the church. As we deal daily with questions of how Scripture relates to the vast and growing ethical challenges posed by today's society, the<i> Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics</i> will be a reliable source of insight and guidance.

Narrated by the horse himself, the book follows his trials and tribulations as he passes from one owner to another and experiences the full spectrum of human treatment&#x2014;from the knowledgeable and kind to the ignorant and cruel.&nbsp; <br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>Beloved by children and animal lovers alike, <i>Black Beauty</i> is now available as part of the Word Cloud Classic series, making it a chic and affordable addition to any library.</p><p>"A horse is a horse of course unless of course the horse is Black Beauty. Animal-loving children have been devoted to Black Beauty throughout this century, and no doubt will continue through the next. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of turn-of-the-century London, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness.<p>Black Beauty tells the story of the horse's own long and varied life, from a well-born colt in a pleasant meadow to an elegant carriage horse for a gentleman to a painfully overworked cab horse. Throughout, Sewell rails--in a gentle, 19th-century way--against animal maltreatment. Young readers will follow Black Beauty's fortunes, good and bad, with gentle masters as well as cruel. Children can easily make the leap from horse-human relationships to human-human relationships, and begin to understand how their own consideration of others may be a benefit to all. (Ages 9 to 12)"</p>Black Beauty's tale, as told by himself, is the fascinating story of the life of a horse a hundred years ago, when horseswere a part of everyone's life.<p></p><p>Although his colthood and early life were happy, Black Beauty tastes the bitterness of cruel grooms and indifferent masters as he passes from hand to hand, progressing from the country to London and back again.</p><p></p><p>This, the most famous horse story ever written, is a must on everyone's reading list.</p></p><h2>The grass is singing (African writers series, 131)</h2><p>This murder story features a Rhodesian farmer&#39;s wife and her houseboy.</p><p>Set in South Africa under white rule, Doris Lessing's first novel is both a riveting chronicle of human disintegration and a beautifully understated social critique. Mary Turner is a self-confident, independent young woman who becomes the depressed, frustrated wife of an ineffectual, unsuccessful farmer. Little by little the ennui of years on the farm work their slow poison, and Mary's despair progresses until the fateful arrival of an enigmatic and virile black servant, Moses. Locked in anguish, Mary and Moses -- master and slave -- are trapped in a web of mounting attraction and repulsion. Their psychic tension explodes in an electrifying scene that ends this disturbing tale of racial strife in colonial South Africa.<p>The Grass Is Singing blends Lessing's imaginative vision with her own vividly remembered early childhood to recreate the quiet horror of a woman's struggle against a ruthless fate.</p><p>Winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, Doris Lessing was one of the most celebrated and distinguished writers of our time, the recipient of a host of international awards.

But when Joel arrives at Skully&#x2019;s Landing, the decaying mansion in rural Alabama, his father is nowhere to be found.

After his parents&#x2019; divorce, he was sent to live with relatives in Monroeville, Alabama. It was here he would meet his lifelong friend, the author Harper Lee. With the 1948 publication of <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms,</i> Capote was catapulted onto the international literary scene and for nearly four decades was a fixture in New York literati and high society circles. Twice awarded the O. Henry Short Story Prize, Capote was also the recipient of a National Institute of Arts and Letters Creative Writing Award and an Edgar Award. Among his many celebrated works are the short-story collection <i>The Grass Harp</i>, the novella <i>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s</i>, the memoirs <i>A Christmas Memory</i> and <i>The Thanksgiving Visitor</i>, and the true-crime masterpiece <i>In Cold Blood</i>.

It&#x2019;s a rough trip no matter how you come, for these washboard roads will loosen up even brandnew cars pretty fast; and hitchhikers always find the going bad. Also, this is lonesome country; and here in the swamplike hollows where tiger lilies bloom the size of a man&#x2019;s head, there are luminous green logs that shine under the dark marsh water like drowned corpses; often the only movement on the landscape is winter smoke winding out the chimney of some sorry-looking farmhouse, or a wing-stiffened bird, silent and arrow-eyed, circling over the black deserted pinewoods.<br><br>Two roads pass over the hinterlands into Noon City; one from the north, another from the south; the latter, known as the Paradise Chapel Highway, is the better of the pair, though both are much the same: desolate miles of swamp and field and forest stretch along either route, unbroken except for scattered signs advertising Red Dot 5� Cigars, Dr. Pepper, NEHI, Grove&#x2019;s Chill Tonic, and 666. Wooden bridges spanning brackish creeks named for long-gone Indian tribes rumble like far-off thunder under a passing wheel; herds of hogs and cows roam the roads at will; now and then a farm-family pauses from work to wave as an auto whizzes by, and watch sadly till it disappears in red dust.<br><br>One sizzling day in early June the Turpentine Company&#x2019;s driver, Sam Radclif, a big balding six-footer with a rough, manly face, was gulping a beer at the Morning Star Caf� in Paradise Chapel when the proprietor came over with his arm around this stranger-boy.<br><br>&#x201c;Hiya, Sam,&#x201d; said the proprietor, a fellow called Sydney Katz. &#x201c;Got a kid here that&#x2019;d be obliged if you could give him a ride to Noon City. Been trying to get there since yesterday. Think you can help?&#x201d;<br><br>Radclif eyed the boy over the rim of his beer glass, not caring much for the looks of him. He had his notions of what a &#x201c;real&#x201d; boy should look like, and this kid somehow offended them. He was too pretty, too delicate and fair-skinned; each of his features was shaped with a sensitive accuracy, and a girlish tenderness softened his eyes, which were brown and very large. His brown hair, cut short, was streaked with pure yellow strands. A kind of tired, imploring expression masked his thin face, and there was an unyouthful sag about his shoulders. He wore long, wrinkled white linen breeches, a limp blue shirt, the collar of which was open at the throat, and rather scuffed tan shoes.<br><br>Wiping a mustache of foam off his upper lips, Radclif said: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s you name, son?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Joel. Jo-el Har-ri-son Knox.&#x201d; He separated the syllables explicitly, as though he thought the driver deaf, but his voice was uncommonly soft.<br><br>&#x201c;That so?&#x201d; drawled Radclif, placing his dry beer glass on the counter. &#x201c;A mighty fancy name, Mister Knox.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy blushed and turned to the proprietor, who promptly intervened: &#x201c;This is a fine boy, Sam. Smart as a whip. Knows words you and me never heard of.&#x201d;<br><br>Radclif was annoyed. &#x201c;Here, Katz,&#x201d; he ordered, &#x201c;fillerup.&#x201d; After the proprietor trundled away to fetch a second beer, Sam said kindly, &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t mean to tease you, son. Where bouts you from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;New Orleans,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I left there Thursday and got here Friday . . . and that was as far as I could go; no one come to meet me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah,&#x201d; said Radclif. &#x201c;Visiting folks in Noon City?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy nodded. &#x201c;My father. I&#x2019;m going to live with him.&#x201d;<br><br>Radclif raised his eyes ceilingward, mumbled &#x201c;Knox&#x201d; several times, then shook his head in a baffled manner. &#x201c;Nope, don&#x2019;t think I know anybody by that name. Sure you&#x2019;re in the right place?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes,&#x201d; said the boy without alarm. &#x201c;Ask Mister Katz, he&#x2019;s heard about my father, and I showed him the letters and . . . wait.&#x201d; He hurried back among the tables of the gloomy caf�, and returned toting a huge tin suitcase that, judging by his grimace, was extremely heavy. The suitcase was colorful with faded souvenir stickers from remote parts of the globe: Paris, Cairo, Venice, Vienna, Naples, Hamburg, Bombay, and so forth. It was an odd thing to see on a hot day in a town the size of Paradise Chapel.<br><br>&#x201c;You been all them places?&#x201d; asked Radclif.<br><br>&#x201c;No-o-o,&#x201d; said the boy, struggling to undo a worn-out leather strap which held the suitcase together. &#x201c;It belonged to my grandfather; that was Major Knox: you&#x2019;ve read about him in history books, I guess. He was a prominent figure in the Civil War. Anyway, this is the valise he used on his wedding trip around the world.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Round the world, eh?&#x201d; said Radclif, impressed. &#x201c;Musta been a mighty rich man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that was a long time ago.&#x201d; He rummaged through his neatly packed possessions till he found a slim package of letters. &#x201c;Here it is,&#x201d; he said, selecting one in a watergreen envelope.<br><br>Radclif fingered the letter a moment before opening it; but presently, with clumsy care, he extracted a green sheet of tissue-like paper and, moving his lips, read:<br><br>Edw. R. Sansom, Esq. Skully&#x2019;s Landing May 18, 19&#x2014;<br><br>My dear Ellen Kendall,<br><br>I am in your debt for answering my letter so quickly; indeed, by return post. Yes, hearing from me after twelve years must have seemed strange, but I can assure you sufficient reason prompted this long silence. However, reading in the Times-Picayune, to the Sunday issue of which we subscribe, of my late wife&#x2019;s passing, may God the Almighty rest her gentle soul, I at once reasoned the honorable thing could only be to again assume my paternal duties, forsaken, lo, these many years. Both the present Mrs Sansom and myself are happy (nay, overjoyed!) to learn you are willing to concede our desire, though, as you remark, your heart will break in doing so. Ah, how well I sympathize with the sorrow such a sacrifice may bring, having experienced similar emotions when, after that final dreadful affair, I was forced to take leave of my only child, whom I treasured, while he was still no more than an infant. But that is all of the lost past. Rest assured, good lady, we here at the Landing have a beautiful home, healthful food, and a cultured atmosphere with which to provide my son.<br><br>As to the journey: we are anxious Joel reach here no later than June First. Now when he leaves New Orleans he should travel via train to Biloxi, at which point he must disembark and purchase a bus ticket for Paradise Chapel, a town some twenty miles south of Noon City. We have at present no mechanical vehicle; therefore, I suggest he remain overnight in P.C. where rooms are let above the Morning Star Caf�, until appropriate arrangements can be made. Enclosed please find a cheque covering such expenses as all this may incur.<br><br>Yrs. Respct. Edw. R. Sansom<br><br>The proprietor arrived with the beer just as Radclif, frowning puzzledly, sighed and tucked the paper back in its envelope. There were two things about this letter that bothered him; first of all, the handwriting: penned in ink the rusty color of dried blood, it was a maze of curlicues and dainty i&#x2019;s dotted with daintier o&#x2019;s. What the hell kind of a man would write like that? And secondly: &#x201c;If your Pa&#x2019;s named Sansom, how come you call yourself Knox?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy stared at the floor embarrassedly. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, and shot Radclif a swift, accusing look, as if the driver was robbing him of something, &#x201c;they were divorced, and mother always called me Joel Knox.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aw, say, son,&#x201d; said Radclif, &#x201c;you oughtn&#x2019;t to have let her done that! Remember, your Pa&#x2019;s your Pa no matter what.&#x201d;<br><br>The proprietor avoided a yearning glance for help which the boy now cast in his direction by having wandered off to attend another customer. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve never seen him,&#x201d; said Joel, dropping the letters into his suitcase and buckling up the strap. &#x201c;Do you know where this place is? Skully&#x2019;s Landing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Landing?&#x201d; Radclif said. &#x201c;Sure, sure I know all about it.&#x201d; He took a deep swallow of beer, let forth a mighty belch, and grinned. &#x201c;Yessir, if I was your Pa I&#x2019;d take down your britches and muss you up a bit.&#x201d; Then, draining the glass, he slapped a half-dollar on the counter, and stood meditatively scratching his hairy chin till a wall clock sounded the hour four: &#x201c;O.K., son, let&#x2019;s shove,&#x201d; he said, starting briskly towards the door.<br><br>After a moment&#x2019;s hesitation the boy lifted his suitcase and followed.<br><br>&#x201c;Come see us again,&#x201d; called the proprietor automatically.</p><h2>Companion Animals: Their Biology, Care, Health, And Management</h2><p><p><b></b> Comprehensive and up-to-date, this book makes a useful reference devoted to companion animals.

While the invaders kill two suspected rustlers, citizens mobilize and eventually turn the tables, surrounding the intruders at a ranch where they intend to capture them by force.

Singly and clustered, these intriguing creatures form as distinctive an element of Gothic architecture as the flying buttress. Nowhere are they more prominent than along the walls of French cathedrals, and this magnificently illustrated volume prowls the ramparts of those medieval buildings to discover hundreds of authentic gargoyle carvings.<br>According to tradition, the gargoyles were posted as sentries, to ward off malevolent spirits and to remind parishioners of the evil beyond the church doors. Author Lester Burbank Bridaham takes a more optimistic view. Noting the stone guardians' whimsical nature, he discusses the artisanal ingenuity involved in their creation. He also points out how they represented a rare sense of freedom in the Middle Ages, in terms of public satire and unbridled artistic enthusiasm. As this book reveals, the timeless appeal of the gargoyle &#x2014; whether symbolic, spiritual, decorative, or fanciful &#x2014; continues to captivate the imagination.</p><p></p><h2>A Historical Introduction to the Philosophy of Science</h2><p>This new edition brings up to date this accessible study of the philosophy of science. Since the time of Plato and Aristotle, scientists and philosophers have raised questions about the proper evaluation of scientific interpretations. <em>A Historical Introduction to the Philosophy of Science</em> is an exposition of differing viewpoints on issues such as the distinction between scientific inquiry and other types of interpretation, the relationship between theories and observation reports; the evaluation of competing theories; and the nature of progress in science. The author makes accessible the philosophy of science to readers who may not have extensive knowledge of formal logic or the history of the several sciences. The third edition incorporates an extended discussion of recent developments. Historicist critics of Logical Empiricism have established that evaluative standards and cognitive aims have changed within the history of science. This edition examines these changes, the recent controversies over scientific realism, casual theories of explanation, Bayesian theories of confirmation, and the search for a non-prescriptive philosophy of science. philosophers have raised questions about the proper evaluation of scientific interpretations.

This fascinating book explores the narcissism of therapists--both its negative aspects and the creative potential it can offer the therapist-patient relationship. Although narcissism is often considered a psychoanalytic term, its scope is not limited to any school of therapy. By illuminating this misunderstood, neglected, even actively avoided aspect of the therapeutic process, this volume gives clinicians significant insight into how to bring about effective change in themselves and their patients.<br></p><p>Sheila Rouslin Welt, MS, RN, is certified for psychotherapy practice in both New York and New Jersey, where she is in private practice.

Indeed, they do it so well that even experienced therapists will learn and profit from reading this well-written book without being narcissistically injured." --Ernest S. Wolf, MD<br><br>"An engaging and insightful work of an underappreciated issue which resides in importance along with concepts of transference and countertransference. This book is a distinguished addition to the growing field of study of the therapist's contribution to psychotherapy rather than the exclusive focus on the patient and the patient's psychopathology.... Interesting, valuable, practical reading for all mental health professionals, this creative and bold work should take its place alongside basic texts in psychotherapy." --David W. Krueger, MD, FAPA<br><br>"Written by two sensitive and highly experienced clinicians, this book deals primarily with the therapist's narcissism and related occupational hazards. However, it is a great deal more: It focuses the searchlight on the intricacies and complexities of the psychotherapeutic process and addresses problems of central importance in psychotherapy....The book is forward-looking and insightful. I warmly recommend it to therapists at all levels of training and experience." --Hans H.

(<i>Contemporary Psychology</i> 1990-04-29)<br><br>"Welt and Herron simply leave absolutely no stone unturned in bringing to light the twists that unconscious narcissism can introduce to the therapeutic process. I stubbornly held out against this gentle restlessness for most of the chapter, but eventually they put their fingers on one experience or another that evoked a chuckle of chagrin or gasp of self-recognition. Repeat readings brought that acknowledgement a page or two sooner, each time!...The soul-searching, while necessary, does not have to be endlessly agonizing. Done purposefully throughout our personal careers, it can be quietly effective. What a relief!"

Despite all the evidence calling for profound change, most organizations still rely on patriarchy and control as their core form of governance. The result is that they stifle initiative and spirit and alienate people from the work they do. This in the face of an increasing need to find ways to be responsive to customers and the wider community.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Peter Block insists that what is required is a dramatic shift in how we distribute power, privilege, and the control of money. &#x201c;Stewardship,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;means giving people at the bottom and the boundaries of the organization choice over how to serve a customer, a citizen, a community. It is the willingness to be accountable for the well-being of the larger organization by operating in service, rather than in control, of those around us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Block has revised and updated the book throughout, including a new introduction addressing what has changed&#x2014;and what hasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;in the twenty years since the book was published and a new chapter on applying stewardship to the common good of the wider community. He covers both the theory of stewardship (in particular how it ameliorates the shortcomings of traditional leadership) and the practice (how it transforms every function and department for the better). And he offers tactical advice as well on gearing up to implement these reforms.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Peter Block</b> is the author of eight books and a partner in the training company Designed Learning. He is the recipient of many awards&#x2014;including the Organization Development Network&#x2019;s Lifetime Achievement Award and ASTD&#x2019;s Award for Distinguished Contribution to Workplace Learning&#x2014;and was named to Training Magazine&#x2019;s HRD Hall of Fame.Introduction<br> to the Second Edition<br><br> What Has Changed?<br><br> REVISING A BOOK after twenty years is an occasion to reflect on what has changed in that time. There is, of course, the wish that the world had gotten better. You want to believe that there is less suffering, more kindness, and, for all peoples, a world of more possibility. This wish to see progress is even stronger considering the practice of stewardship, a clearly idealistic and spirit-based undertaking.<br><br> Stewardship as used here is meant to be a choice to (1) act in service of the long run, and (2) act in service to those with little power. In historical terms, this has meant to care for the well-being of an unborn king or the next generation. For today&#x2019;s world, it translates into creating accountable and committed workplaces without resorting to increased control or compliance as governing strategies. This is not an easy assignment, considering the still-dominant paradigm of leadership, which is about good parenting and its stronger cousin, patriarchy. Patriarchal leadership, the common practice in most organizations, acts in service of the short term and works in the interest of those with high power, not low power.<br><br> Stewardship, then, is an intention to distribute power widely, especially to those at the lowest levels of the organization. It calls us to organize workplaces based on relatedness and collaboration as an alternative to the bell-curve ideology of competitiveness that is used to rationalize patriarchy.<br><br> Stewardship also is a call for a purpose larger than today&#x2019;s drive for material gain, and it pays attention to supporting the common good for our communities, the earth, and people outside the usual cast of stakeholders. This takes us a step away from the individualism and self-interest that is so prevalent.<br><br> Against this backdrop, here are reflections on developments over the last twenty years that make stewardship an even more urgent form of governance.<br><br> It&#x2019;s a Digital World<br><br> The biggest change in organizational life is that we have been beamed into all the joys and sorrows of the virtual and digital world. It is a romanticized world, riding on the wings of speed and frictionless transactions with no human beings involved. It is mesmerizing to grasp the world in a handheld device, much smarter than we will ever be. Technology is credited with bringing the world closer together, spreading democracy, changing the nature of business, supplying round-the-clock connectivity. Geography has been made obsolete. Here are some noteworthy aspects of this life in a work context:<br><br> � Workers are members of teams made up of people they have never been in a room with. This has given rise to the question &#x201c;How do we build a team that never or rarely meets face-to-face?&#x201d;<br><br> � We have willingly given up the forty-hour workweek. We are online and in touch and reachable most of our waking hours. If you ask people to park their cell phones at the door, 40 percent say that this is not possible.<br><br> � We work at home. Our bedroom has become our office. We can work in our pajamas most of the time. This allows us to move our residence anywhere, supposedly take better care of our family, and have more control over our time. We can also go to school at home, so our dining room becomes our classroom.<br><br> What is new is the wedding of futurism to what might be called &#x201c;virtualism&#x201d;: a vision of the future within which we somehow take leave of material reality and glide about in a pure information economy.<br><br> &#x2014;Matthew B. Crawford, Shop Class as Soulcraft<br><br> � With a device in our pocket and plugs in our ears, we can have background music or be in phone contact all the time. You go to public places and you see that most people have something in their ear and are somewhere else. There is no longer a need to be here now. You can go anywhere but here, anytime you wish.<br><br> � We all participate in this electronic world, one where speed is a value in and of itself. If something is quicker, it is attractive. If we are quicker, we are attractive. Slow food is considered a revolution. Fast food, a value proposition.<br><br> � Controlling costs is now the dominant value for most organizations, replacing the priority once given to the customer and the employee. We can now outsource most every job and function (except top management) in order to reduce labor and benefit costs. We cut down on travel costs and training on the rationale that current audio and video technology approximates the sights and sounds of being in the room together in real time.<br><br> The virtual world is sold on these features. A promise of more freedom to the individual. Work at home, learn at will, and control your time. Get information you need on demand. Be a global citizen. All true. Big change in twenty years.<br><br> What Is Good for Business Is Good for the World<br><br> A second major shift is that the private sector has fully come into its own power to name the debate and create the context for what matters. It is the dominant sector. In other times, the church and the military set the tone for the society. Once it was the government and concern for the social good. Not so now.<br><br> The lens for assessing our common interests and institutional well-being is the business lens. It is the focusing device. This defines the conversation: Government is primarily assessed on its waste. The social-service sector is encouraged to merge, eliminate overlap, increase leverage and productivity. The private sector sings, &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t a school be like a business?&#x201d; Our answer to the &#x201c;public education problem&#x201d; is to institute variable pay for performance and stronger measurements as tools for reform. Pure business plays. Intuition and experience have been replaced by evidence. Evidence-based medicine, evidence-based learning, evidence-based decision making. All business terms. This language and reverence for business seeps into all conversation about a better future. We are also looking for businesspeople to run every institution: the hospital, the school, the prison, the government, social services, the church, even the Girl Scouts. We consider business success the ultimate credential.<br><br> This is not an argument against business, for businesses are the stabilizing institutions in most communities. They contribute to communities in many more ways than creating jobs. They are the institutions most open to change and adaptation to the new world. They also bring to the community talented and committed people. Businesses provide some of our best foreign policy too; the globalization of business puts a crack in the class structure, has fought racism, and helped create a middle class where none existed. The point is not to paint business as a villain. The point is to recognize its power to frame the culture, to frame the context for how we choose to be together.<br><br> In recognizing the power of the business perspective, we see how it affects not only the way we work but also who we are becoming. It defines our new heroes. The contemporary hero is now the entrepreneur. A single soul with faith in an idea that reinvents a marketplace, disrupts a whole industry, takes everything to scale, creates new needs, and provides an escort service into the future. This inventive instinct can also take over domains once reserved for God. We clone sheep today, humans tomorrow. We are in the process of creating synthetic versions of aliveness; we send avatars to meetings, watch a screen more hours than we can count, create video games to simulate experience. In all this we are witnessing the second creation of the world, as if to say, &#x201c;Thank you, God, for your hard work and the good beginning; thank you for providing a good role model&#x2014;we can take it from here.&#x201d; This economic usurpation of God produces a certain amount of guilt, so now we put the word social in front of entrepreneur. The social entrepreneur speaks to our wish to integrate our surrender to consumption and materialism with the universal desire to do good in the world.<br><br> Side Effects<br><br> These two concurrent forces&#x2014;the growing virtual and digital world and the preeminence of the business perspective&#x2014;have their grip on us. They live on a set of assumptions so deeply embedded in our consciousness that we rarely question them and so cannot ever solve the fundamental issues that keep us and our organizations in patriarchy&#x2019;s power. These assumptions have a cost. What we see in the last two decades is increasing isolation, anxiety, fear, and concentration of wealth and power. This reality is what calls us to stay interested in the idea of stewardship. The point of this book.<br><br> In this journey to the stewardship possibility, we can note some ways in which these cultural forces are shaping our lives:<br><br> � Electronic connection, while touted as valuable for building relationships, has the effect of isolating us more deeply. Take Phil, a friend who works at home for a large technology company. This allows him to move around the country, following his wife&#x2019;s career. The price he pays is that his time on the computer is minutely monitored by the company. The normal workweek is fifty hours, but he is expected to deliver fifty-eight billable hours a week.<br><br> � Phil works in a world where there is little travel budget for him to be in the room with other employees or to see how what he has designed is being used. There is no budget for his development. The digital revolution that promises more freedom also impinges on our privacy and provides infinitely more control than we thought possible. It creates more instrumental relationships. Thus the isolation.<br><br> � Stewardship requires a level of trust and relatedness and is about putting choice close to the edge. The electronic world shares information widely, but that does not necessarily mean it builds relationships. It may sustain them once built, but something is lost by not being in the room with other human beings. If we want to decentralize choice and power, the virtual world has ushered in vast surveillance capacity. Jobs that once held some privacy, like driving for a living, are now monitored closely. Your workstation can now be monitored from afar. The virtual world also has eliminated incidental contact, like passing in a hall, eating in a lunchroom, chatting before and after meetings, or going in and out of work. These peripheral moments, captured in sideways glances, are what build social capital; unplanned, face-to-face encounters encourage the informality where trust and connection are built.<br><br> � E-mail and social media are another substitute for seeing each other. We have come to believe that we are communicating with each other when we send an e-mail. Maybe, maybe not. Facebook creates the illusion of having five hundred friends. We can exchange photographs, be up to date with the smallest details of our lives, but even so, we are still watching a screen. The handheld device becomes an extension of our arm and has made eye contact a rarity among strangers. We have confused an amazing information gadget with a tool of relatedness.<br><br> � The divide between personal life and work life has become blurred. We all have a major concern about work/life balance, how to balance work life and personal life, which means we are way off balance, and not in the direction of too much personal life. If as stewards we care for the common good and well-being of a community, yielding so much sovereignty to the workplace makes that care harder to act on.<br><br> � The current business narrative is fundamentally one of scarcity. No amount of earnings, no amount of productivity improvement, is enough. Even in good economic times the narrative is one of fierce competition, more cost reduction, grow or die. One effect is increased fear at work. People seem more afraid of their bosses now than twenty years ago. The fear is joined by a schizophrenic sense of enormous business growth and success at the same time as individual earnings and well-being are declining or staying flat. Stewardship is a narrative of abundance: it says that what we have is enough, that there are limits to growth, and it expands our field of vision to care for something larger than profitability.<br><br> � The rush of globalization destabilizes our sense of place and security. While globalization has the advantages of increasing our cultural competence, increasing our understanding of other cultures, and providing a positive kind of foreign policy, it moves our center of gravity into unknown territory. Being global citizens can cost us our sense of place, our stability, and the experience of knowing where we belong. Stewardship relies on trust, familiarity, and continuity to do its work.<br><br> � We are consumed by our anxiety about success. Parents are more worried about the employment future of their children. We have tiger moms and helicopter parents who want their children to win in the competitive world we have constructed. Home has become a child-management-services bureau where every day is scheduled for positive outcomes. In some cases, when you hire an employee, you are also hiring the person&#x2019;s parental management team; one day you might have to answer to his mom or dad on why you rated their son only above average. Stewardship supports the assumptions of a cooperative world; it replaces competition with collaboration, self-interest with service. It asks us to care more about meaning and impact than about the traditional concern for upward mobility.<br><br> � Finally, we continue to be disappointed in our leaders, which means our expectations of them are beyond fulfillment. We seek transformational leaders and relational leaders. We want our mentors, and everyone who can afford it wants a coach. We still love leadership; we just want it to be more benevolent. This focus on leaders tends to centralize accountability instead of distributing it. It says that leaders are cause and employees are effect. Stewardship inverts this and suggests that employees are the central point and bosses need to earn their right to govern.<br><br> Goods We Can Build Upon<br><br> All these forces create some positive counterforces that support and reinforce the shift in our thinking toward stewardship. For example:<br><br> � The longing for hope, stability, and optimism is as strong as ever. In the world of religion, while participation in the traditional churches has declined in the West, the emergent churches here have strong growth. They make fewer demands to embrace specific beliefs and focus more on creating a successful lifestyle and being part of a community. They give their members an opportunity for connection that has disappeared from the neighborhood and the workplace. Around the world we see growing resistance to the materialism of the West. It is frightening in some of its forms but is clearly a reaction to witnessing the disruption of tradition and culture in the West.<br><br> � The environmental movement is touching our lives and our organizations. At a surface level, every business has turned green, at least in its advertising. Government is now also turning green, and proud of it. This is a good thing. This means that conversation about the environment is commonplace. The social responsibility of business is on the table. All these support the steward.<br><br> � There are always organizations that strive to create an alternative to the traditional command-and-control cultures. Most high-tech companies seek less social distance between levels. They create more informal ways of being together, make the office more like home, and encourage sociability. They are valuing more ownership from employees and more decisions at lower levels. Some older major companies, like Mars and Crown Equipment, still value the importan...</p><h2>On Cooking (A Textbook of Culinary Fundamentals)</h2><p>Over 1,2500 color photographs identify raw foods and ingredients, illustrate the tools and equipment uned in professional kitchens and depict procedural steps in the preparation process.

What is the lesson when you lose someone you really love? Just what are the lessons of life's hard times?<br> <br>Bestselling author Iyanla Vanzant has had an amazing and difficult life -- one of great challenges that unmasked her wonderful gifts and led to wisdom gained. In this simple book, she uses her own personal experiences to show how life's hardships can be re-languaged and revisioned to become lessons that teach us as we grow, heal, and learn to love. The pain of the past does not have to be today's reality. Iyanla Vanzant is an example of how yesterday's tears become the seeds of today's hope, renewal, and strength.</p><p><i>"Life is about cleaning up the crap and, while you're doing it, being okay with the fact that you have to do it.... A word of caution. You can't get caught up in the crap! If you do, you will surely lose sight of the real meaning of life and lose your Self."</i><p> Iyanla Vanzant knows plenty about dealing with just such "crap." She has led a difficult life, full of periods of abuse and self-loathing, but she has managed to learn "the lessons beneath the tears" and move beyond her grief and into understanding. In <i>Yesterday, I Cried</i>, she passes these lessons along, continually stressing that past hardships can and should be used to teach us how to grow, heal, and love others and ourselves. The message is one that has been echoed in her bestsellers <i>One Day My Soul Just Opened Up</i> and <i>In the Meantime</i>, but when presented as a memoir, the result is particularly moving.</p><p> As any regular <i>Oprah</i> viewer knows, Vanzant is a feisty and charismatic orator, and her no-nonsense style translates well into print. She is candid about her experiences without ever painting herself as a victim, effectively coming across as inspirational rather than preachy or self-pitying. The tone of the book is especially engaging because she seems to be actively working out her problems as she writes, gently pulling the reader into what becomes a mutual catharsis. "Of all things to master," she asks, "why did I have to pick tears?" By the end of <i>Yesterday, I Cried</i>, she finds the answer. And in searching the depths of her own soul, she encourages others to do the same.</p>Rev. Dr. Iyanla Vanzant, author and internationally renowned speaker, is best known for her riveting work as the host of <i>Iyanla Fix My Life</i> on the OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network). Oprah herself has called Iyanla, <i>&#x201c;the most powerful spiritual healer, fixer, teacher, on the planet.&#x201d;</i>&nbsp; Oprah Winfrey has publicly acknowledged that Fix My Life and Iyanla was the turning point for the fledgling Oprah Winfrey Network.

Sharing her brand of practical spiritual wisdom, a blend of ancient African wisdom and universal principles, Iyanla has touched the minds and heart of more than 8 million readers in 23 languages. Her latest venture, the creation of MasterPeace Body Therapy, a line of natural body care products has received rave reviews on HSN.<br> <br>Cooking and making scrapbooks are her guilty pleasures. Studying the Bible and other sacred texts is the foundation of her life. Iyanla cherishes her collection of over 100 Bibles in various translations. Watching re-runs of <i>Law and Order </i>is her joy. Spending time with her grandchildren and doing her own laundry is what keeps her grounded.

It reveals how national icons evolve and how commemmorative issues reflect fundamental design as well as creative concerns. It also highlights the role of the stamp designers, showing how many famous artists, including M.C. Escher, Hans Erne, Edmund Doulac, David Gentleman and Eric Gill, have contributed to the development of stamp design. A whole chapter is devoted to the design of British and French colonial issues.</p><p>David Scott is Professor of French, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.</p><h2>Splash 1: America&#39;s Best Watercolors</h2><p>Contains samples of watercolor paintings and analyzes and critiques these works by looking at concept, technique, composition, value, color, texture and pattern, style, light, mood, and creativity.</p><p></p><h2>Science And Society</h2><p><p> <b>Part of Longman&#x2019;s successful Topic&#x2019;s Reader series, <i>Science and Society</i> is a brief thematic reader that touches on the nature of science and various scientific issues and controversies. </b> </p></p><p><b> <i>Science and Society</i> <br> Richard W.

These Huguenots survived persecution and armed conflict to win however briefly freedom of worship, civil rights, and unique status as a protected minority. But in 1685, the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes abolished all Huguenot rights, and more than 200,000 of the radical Calvinists were forced to flee across Europe, some even farther. &nbsp; In this capstone work, Geoffrey Treasure tells the full story of the Huguenots&#x2019; rise, survival, and fall in France over the course of a century and a half. He explores what it was like to be a Huguenot living in a state within a state,&#x201d; weaving stories of ordinary citizens together with those of statesmen, feudal magnates, leaders of the Catholic revival, Henry of Navarre, Catherine de&#x2019; Medici, Louis XIV, and many others. Treasure describes the Huguenots' disciplined community, their faith and courage, their rich achievements, and their unique place within Protestantism and European history. The Huguenot exodus represented a crucial turning point in European history, Treasure contends, and he addresses the significance of the Huguenot story the story of a minority group with the power to resist and endure in one of early modern Europe&#x2019;s strongest nations.</p><p><b>Geoffrey Treasure</b> was senior master at Harrow School before his retirement.&nbsp;He lives in Herefordshire, UK.<br> &nbsp;"[An] enjoyable and authoritative account, which, in telling the story of the Huguenots, doubles as a fine political and religious history of France over the course of two troubled centuries.&#x201d;&#x2014;Peter Marshall, <i>Literary Review</i> (Peter Marshall <i>Literary Review</i> 2013-07-01)<br><br>&#x2018;A richly detailed study of the politics and personalities of a religious minority.&#x2019;&#x2014;P D Smith,<i> The Guardian</i> (P D Smith <i>The Guardian</i> 2014-09-27)<br><br>&#x201c;A formidable work, covering complex, fascinating, horrifying and often paradoxical events over a period of more than 200 years . . .

Although he published many books, hundreds of recordings and dozens of films, his contributions to popular and academic journals have never been collected. This collection of writings, introduced by Lomax&#39;s daughter Anna, reintroduces these essential writings. Drawing on the Lomax Archives in New York, this book brings together articles from the 30s onwards. It is divided into four sections, each capturing a distinct period in the development of Lomax&#39;s life and career: the original years as a collector and promoter; the period from 1950-58 when Lomax was recording thorughout Europe; the folk music revival years; and finally his work in academia.</p><p>Ronald Cohen (volume editor) is professor of History at Indiana University, Northwest (Gary, IN).

Why are canines so varied compared with other species? How do dogs perceive the world? Narrated by Rudy, a chirpy, bandana-wearing pooch, this work of graphic nonfiction takes a deep dive into the world of canines. The jokes and sunny cartoon illustrations featuring tongue-lolling dogs will entice elementary school students. However, the challenging content and intricate sentence structure may stymie these readers. Most of the book is devoted to explaining canine evolution and genetics, including dominant and recessive traits, natural selection, and adaptation. Rudy also covers anatomy, behavior, and the development of breeds. Though the visuals clarify some of the more difficult points, the busy layouts full of text are daunting. The lengthy further reading list reflects Hirsch's meticulous research but contains only titles, articles, and websites that are aimed at adults. VERDICT Despite its youthful format, this volume is best suited for those with a basic grounding in biology. Middle schoolers seeking a user-friendly guide to read alongside their science textbooks may appreciate it.&#x2014;Mahnaz Dar, School Library Journal</p><h2>In Search of the American Spirit: The Political Thought of Orestes Brownson</h2><p><p>Gregory S. Butler examines Brownson&#x2019;s work by drawing on the theoretical perspective of the political philosopher Eric Voegelin. Through Brownson&#x2019;s works, Butler identifies the symbols that aid both in expressing the meaning of the American experiment and in illustrating the current debate about the failures of the human experience in a secular society.</p><p>Butler gives special attention to Brownson&#x2019;s belief that the moral interpretation assigned to American political symbols Liberty, Equality, the Rights of Man derives from the American understanding of the nature and destiny of the human soul. Brownson eventually came to believe that humankind can only progress by finding inspiration in the divine and that the American political order must be based in the Christian, especially the Roman Catholic, moral tradition. Butler&#x2019;s work offers at once the most complete picture of Orestes Brownson&#x2019;s political thought and a distinctive view of American history.</p></p><p><p><b>Gregory S.

Robert Kiely, a distinguished scholar of modernist literature and a historian and critic of exceptional sensibility, has a keen eye and uncanny ability to capture details of significance and to prompt the reader to look again and to see with fresh eyes that the lives of saints and the Renaissance depictions of them are anything but dull, uniform, or narrowly orthodox. His beautifully written and thoughtful book treats saints seriously as human religious figures (not icons of perfection), brought to life by great Italian paintings in dialogue with scripture, legend, and poetry.</p><p>Wise, learned, and readable, and offering a rare combination of insight into religion, literature, and art, this ravishingly illustrated and vividly written volume should be by your side whenever you pick up a classic text, look at a Renaissance painting, or spend a few moments in private meditation or prayer.</p></p><p><b>Robert Kiely</b> is professor emeritus of English, Harvard University. His books include <i>The Romantic Novel in England</i>; <i>Beyond Egotism: The Fiction of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence</i>; and <i>Reverse Tradition, Postmodern Fiction and the Nineteenth-Century Novel.</i>Starred Review. Kiely's knowledge of literature and his fascination with religious images come together exquisitely in a book that will be appreciated as much for its analysis of great art as its commentary on relevant texts. The Yale University English professor emeritus deftly employs and intermingles both in a project that took root nearly two decades ago as he visited churches, monasteries, and museums during a stay in Tuscany. Kiely concentrates here on the religious art of 15th- and 16th-century Italy and a dozen or so saints he particularly likes, including his acknowledged favorite, Francis of Assisi. He incorporates as well a chapter on 19th-century English art critic John Ruskin, whose Protestant sensibilities were affected by exposure to Catholic culture in art. Kiely examines, too, how artists struggled to depict the humanity of Mary, Christ's mother, and reflects on the contrast &nbsp;between the worldly life of the artist Sodoma and his paintings of St. Benedict and the monastic life. Engagingly written with 130 fine reproductions, this is a book that is certain to attract a diversity of readers with interests in religion, literature, and art. (Oct.)

His landmark analysis shows how the notion of popular sovereignty�&#x20ac;&#x201d;the unexpected offspring of an older, equally fictional notion, the "divine right of kings"�&#x20ac;&#x201d;has worked in our history and remains a political force today.</p><p>Edmund S.

The author of The Genuine Article; American Slavery, American Freedom; Benjamin Franklin; and American Heroes, among many others.For Morgan, popular sovereigntygovernment of, by and for the peopleis a myth. Professor emeritus of history at Yale, he argues, in effect, that representative democracy is a tool to bolster rule by the powerful few over the many; the majority are thus led to believe they control their own destiny. In this quietly subversive rereading of our history, American colonists perfected the fiction of popular rule by involving voters in extravagant electoral campaigns and by insisting that elected representatives derived their power from their constituents. Meanwhile, elitist colonial rulers who owned considerable property pulled strings to get their way. Earlier, in England, members of the House of Commons and reformers challenged another governing fictionthe divine right of kingsand in so doing paved the way for popular sovereignty. Morgan offers a thought-provoking look at how the founding fathers assumed power. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jane Eyre (Volume 5) (Knickerbocker Classics, 5)</h2><p><p><b>Explore Charlotte Bronte's world full of shocking secrets, captivating characters, and dark romance in</b><i><b> Jane Eyre.</b><br><br> Jane Eyre </i>is the heart-wrenching story of a young girl saddled with both a cruel aunt and a bitter upbringing at Lowood School.

In this groundbreaking work, Dr. Eugene Bliss shows that the hypnotic capability of the mind is important to the theory and practice of psychiatry, and suggests that it deserves much more attention and research. In Multiple Personality, Allied Disorders and Hypnosis, Bliss explores both the nature of multiple personality and hypnosis, and discusses how an understanding of the latter can provide insight into the nature of certain psychiatric disorders. For instance, he views multiple personality as a form of self-hypnosis, an instance of learned schizophrenia rather than an organic disorder, as is generally thought. He outlines the trace elements involved in multiple personality and other psychiatric disorders, provides a fascinating history of the origins and current ideas about hypnosis, and gives a detailed account of the use of hypnosis in the treatment of multiple personality. Based on thirty years of clinical experience, and filled with insightful personal observations, Multiple Personality, Allied Disorders and Hypnosis is an informative, fascinating book for psychiatrists, psychologists, and anyone intrigued by hypnosis and its possible beneficial use.</p><p>Eugene L.

Bowen Series, 34)</h2><p><p>American higher education was transformed between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of World War I. During this period, U.S. colleges underwent fundamental changes--changes that helped to create the modern university we know today. Most significantly, the study of the sciences and the humanities effectively dissolved the Protestant framework of learning by introducing a new secularized curriculum. This secularization has long been recognized as a decisive turning point in the history of American education. Until now, however, there has been remarkably little attention paid to the details of how this transformation came about. Here, at last, Jon Roberts and James Turner identify the forces and explain the events that reformed the college curriculum during this era.</p><p>The first section of the book examines how the study of science became detached from theological considerations. Previously, one of the primary pursuits of "natural scientists" was to achieve an understanding of the workings of the divine in earthly events. During the late nineteenth century, however, scientists reduced the scope of their inquiries to subjects that could be isolated, measured, and studied objectively. In pursuit of "scientific truth," they were drawn away from the larger "truths" that they had once sought. On a related path, social scientists began to pursue the study of human society more scientifically, attempting to generalize principles of behavior from empirically observed events.</p><p>The second section describes the revolution that occurred in the humanities, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, when the study of humanities was largely the study of Greek and Latin. By 1900, however, the humanities were much more broadly construed, including such previously unstudied subjects as literature, philosophy, history, and art history. The "triumph of the humanities" represented a significant change in attitudes about what constituted academic knowledge and, therefore, what should be a part of the college curriculum.</p><p><i>The Sacred and the Secular University</i> rewrites the history of higher education in the United States. It will interest all readers who are concerned about American universities and about how the content of a "college education" has changed over the course of the last century.</p><p>"[Jon Roberts and James Turner's] thoroughly researched and carefully argued presentations invite readers to revisit stereotypical generalizations and to rethink the premises developed in the late nineteenth century that underlie the modern university. At the least, their arguments challenge crude versions of the secularization thesis as applied to higher education."--From the foreword by William G. Bowen and Harold T. Shapiro</p></p><p><p>"A brief, highly readable survey of the de-Christianization of the American academy that should attract a wide readership among historians of education, science, and religion."<b>--Ronald Numbers, University of Wisconsin</b></p><p>"The issues of religion in public life and the role of religion in colleges are receiving a lot of attention today.

In order to keep the prerequisites to a minimum, the author restricts attention to matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. This approach keeps the discussion concrete, allows the reader to get to the heart of the subject quickly, and covers all of the most interesting examples. The book also introduces the often-intimidating machinery of roots and the Weyl group in a gradual way, using examples and representation theory as motivation. The text is divided into two parts. The first covers Lie groups and Lie algebras and the relationship between them, along with basic representation theory. The second part covers the theory of semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras, beginning with a detailed analysis of the representations of SU(3). The author illustrates the general theory with numerous images pertaining to Lie algebras of rank two and rank three, including images of root systems, lattices of dominant integral weights, and weight diagrams. This book is sure to become a standard textbook for graduate students in mathematics and physics with little or no prior exposure to Lie theory.

Readers see how and why many of our most important financial tools and institutions loans, interest rates, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, the corporation, and the New York Stock Exchange, to name a few came into being. We see, for instance, how ancient Rome developed an early form of equity finance that resembles the modern corporation and read about the first modern corporation the Dutch East India Company and its innovative means of financing the exploration and expansion of European business ventures around the globe. We also meet remarkable financial innovators, such as the 13th century Italian Fibonacci of Pisa, whose mathematics of money became the foundation for later developments in the technology of Western European finance (and may explain why the West surpassed the East in financial sophistication). And we even discover a still surviving "perpetuity" dating from the Dutch Age of Reason an instrument that has been paying interest since the mid 17th century. <br> Placing our current age of financial revolution in fascinating historical perspective, <em>The Origins of Value</em> tells a remarkable story of invention, illuminating many key episodes in the course of financial history.<br></p><p><br><strong>William Goetzmann</strong> is the Edwin J.

Yet the establishment of the forty-eight contiguous states was hardly a foregone conclusion, and the federal government played a critical role in its success. This book examines the politics of American expansion, showing how the government's regulation of population movements on the frontier, both settlement and removal, advanced national aspirations for empire and promoted the formation of a white settler nation.</p><p><i>Building an American Empire</i> details how a government that struggled to exercise plenary power used federal land policy to assert authority over the direction of expansion by engineering the pace and patterns of settlement and to control the movement of populations. At times, the government mobilized populations for compact settlement in strategically important areas of the frontier; at other times, policies were designed to actively restrain settler populations in order to prevent violence, international conflict, and breakaway states. Paul Frymer examines how these settlement patterns helped construct a dominant racial vision for America by incentivizing and directing the movement of white European settlers onto indigenous and diversely populated lands. These efforts were hardly seamless, and Frymer pays close attention to the failures as well, from the lack of further expansion into Latin America to the defeat of the black colonization movement.</p><p><i>Building an American Empire</i> reveals the lasting and profound significance government settlement policies had for the nation, both for establishing America as dominantly white and for restricting broader aspirations for empire in lands that could not be so racially engineered.</p></p><p><p>"Ranging across a wide array of topics and scholarship, this book remaps large parts of American history. In Frymer's telling, the nation&#x2019;s territorial expansion emerges as a far more fascinating and perilous journey than we had imagined."<b>--Edward L. Ayers, author of the Bancroft Prize-winning <i>In the Presence of Mine Enemies: The Civil War in the Heart of America, 1859-1863</i></b></p><p>"<i>Building an American Empire</i> is a profound achievement in the study of American state formation. Through a dazzling array of sources and a painstaking analysis of federal land policy, Frymer beautifully demonstrates how the &#x2018;weak' American state could nonetheless pursue a project of dramatic territorial expansion. In the process, he both highlights the centrality of settler notions of membership to the path of American political development as well as the ideological and racial diversity that persisted at the edges of federal power. This is a foundational work that all students of American politics will have to reckon with, one that links the national experience to global projects of colonial state formation and that captures the deep interrelation between race, empire, and state building in U.S. history."<b>--Aziz Rana, author of <i>The Two Faces of American Freedom</i></b></p><p>"In this sweeping, authoritative, clearly written, and bracingly revisionist history of the formative era of American land policy, Paul Frymer shows how governmental institutions worked, often in hidden ways, to create a settler society dedicated to white supremacy. It has been fifty years since a scholar has analyzed the mechanisms of territorial expansion in such detail, making <i>Building an American Empire</i> essential reading for specialists in the history of immigration, state building, race relations, and American political development."<b>--Richard R. John, Columbia University, author of <i>Network Nation: Inventing American Telecommunications</i></b></p><p>"<i>Building an American Empire</i> is full of interesting ideas, facts, and insights. Frymer argues that the American state vigorously engaged in acquiring and governing land, and built a predominantly white society that employed racial removal and envisioned a marginal role for Native Americans and free blacks."<b>--David Brian Robertson, author of <i>The Original Compromise: What the Constitution's Framers Were Really Thinking</i></b></p><p>"Frymer has crafted an intellectually ambitious, important book that addresses one of the most significant questions in American history: how did a tiny coastal federation with a weak state effectively settle a rich and contested&#x2014;not to mention already occupied&#x2014;land mass?"<b>--Brian Balogh, author of <i>A Government Out of Sight: The Mystery of National Authority in Nineteenth-Century America</i></b></p><b>Paul Frymer</b> is professor of politics and director of the Program in Law and Public Affairs at Princeton University.

Historian Thomas F. Army, Jr., identifies strength in engineering&#x2015;not superior military strategy or industrial advantage&#x2015;as the critical determining factor in the war&#x2019;s outcome.</p><p>Army finds that Union soldiers were able to apply scientific ingenuity and innovation to complex problems in a way that Confederate soldiers simply could not match. Skilled Free State engineers who were trained during the antebellum period benefited from basic educational reforms, the spread of informal educational practices, and a culture that encouraged learning and innovation. During the war, their rapid construction and repair of roads, railways, and bridges allowed Northern troops to pass quickly through the forbidding terrain of the South as retreating and maneuvering Confederates struggled to cut supply lines and stop the Yankees from pressing any advantage.</p><p>By presenting detailed case studies from both theaters of the war, Army clearly demonstrates how the soldiers&#x2019; education, training, and talents spelled the difference between success and failure, victory and defeat.

While scientific ethics has advanced only gradually, the science <i>of</i> ethics burst into existence in 1903 with the publication of G.E. Moore's <i>Principia Ethica</i>, which did for the study of morality what Whitehead and Russell's <i>Principia Mathematica</i> did for mathematics--clarify old confusions and define terms that are still with us today. Practically overnight, ethicists turned into meta-ethicists, studying their own terms to establish theoretical ground on which to stand before trying to build any prescriptive edifices.<p> Moore begins by clearing up some of the most widely spread confusions plaguing moral philosophy, such as the naturalistic fallacy of Bentham, Spencer, and others who insisted on a precise, concrete definition of <i>good</i>. According to Moore, we have to settle for an intuitive assessment of goodness, and his arguments are powerfully compelling. Proceeding to define terms and territory that have lasted a century, he revolutionized philosophy and single-handedly altered the course of ethical studies for generations. While <i>Principia Ethica</i> isn't the easiest book to read (a dictionary of philosophy comes in handy for most of us), it is well worth careful study by anyone interested in the difference between right and wrong. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Recognized as the definitive starting point for twentieth-century ethical theory, the text is reprinted with the previously unpublished preface Moore wrote for a planned, but never completed, second edition. &#34;Free Will&#34; and &#34;The Conception of Intrinsic Value&#34; are also included from his later ethical writings.</p><h2>Tales from China (Oxford Myths and Legends)</h2><p>This collection of Chinese stories begins with the great legends of how Earth and Heaven came into being, and of how the archer Yi rid the Emperor Yao of the menace of the ten suns. Engrossing folk tales about ghosts and rainmakers, poor students and magicians, and the man who was nearly made into fishpaste flesh out Chinese culture, character, and customs. Throughout all these stories, the author has kept the subtle oriental flavour of the originals, bringing to life all the magic and mystery of China.</p><p><br><strong>Cyril Birch</strong> is a professor in the Department of Oriental Languages at Berkeley in California.<br>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>Roughing It</h2><p>Mark Twain's humorous account of his six years in Nevada, San Francisco, and the Sandwich Islands is a patchwork of personal anecdotes and tall tales, many of them told in the "vigorous new vernacular" of the West. Selling seventy five thousand copies within a year of its publication in 1872, <i>Roughing It </i>was greeted as a work of "wild, preposterous invention and sublime exaggeration" whose satiric humor made "pretension and false dignity ridiculous." Meticulously restored from a variety of original sources, the text is the first to adhere to the author's wishes in thousands of details of wording, spelling, and punctuation, and includes all of the 304 first-edition illustrations. With its comprehensive and illuminating notes and supplementary materials, which include detailed maps tracing Mark Twain's western travels, this Mark Twain Library <i>Roughing It </i>must be considered the standard edition for readers and students of Mark Twain.</p><p>There is no nicer surprise for a reader than to discover that an acknowledged classic really does deliver the goods. Mark Twain's <i>Roughing It</i> is just such a book. The adventure tale is a delight from start to finish and is just as engrossing today as it was 125 years ago when it first appeared. <p> <i>Roughing It</i> tells the true-ish escapades of Twain in the American West. Although he clearly "speaks with forked tongue," <i>Roughing It</i> is informative as well as humorous. From stagecoach travel to the etiquette of prospecting, the modern reader gains considerable insight into that much-fictionalized time and place. Do you know about sagebrush, for example? </p><blockquote> Sage-brush is very fair fuel, but as a vegetable it is a distinguished failure. Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his illegitimate child, the mule. But their testimony to its nutritiousness is worth nothing, for they will eat pine knots, or anthracite coal, or brass filings, or lead pipe, or old bottles, or anything that comes handy, and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters for dinner. </blockquote> <i>Roughing It</i> is informally structured around the narrator's attempts to strike it rich. He meets a motley, colorful crew in the process; many mishaps occur, and it shouldn't surprise you that Twain does not emerge a man of means. But he withstands it all in such a relentless good humor that his misfortune inspires laughter. <i>Roughing It</i> is wonderful entertainment and reminds you how funny the world can be--even its grimmer districts--when you're traveling with the right writer.12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Dark Abyss of Time: The History of the Earth and the History of Nations from Hooke to Vico</h2><p><p>"A rich historical pastiche of 17th- and 18th-century philosophy, science, and religion."&#x2014;G.

Steen Eiler Rasmussen concentrates here on the town as a unity, as a whole composed of buildings and places.</p><p>Most of the town plans are scaled to 1:20,000 for easy over-all comparison; several famous places are reduced to 1:2000 for closer comparison. The buildings are for the most part presented in three views: the first, <i>en face</i>: then the same view, minus the fa�ade; and finally a top view, as if the upper stories had been removed. The result is a picture not of static fa�ade and monument but of rooms and houses and towns where people live.</p></p><p>Steen Eiler Rasmussen was Professor of Architecture at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen and Visiting Professor at M.I.T., Yale, Pennsylvania, and the University of California, Berkeley, and lectured widely at universities in Europe and the United States.

Was it perpetually at odds with other currents of the Left? The authors in this collection take up these questions of geographical and political peripheries. Building on recent research that has emphasized the plural origins of anarchist thought and practice, they reflect on the histories and cultures of the antistatist mutual aid movements of the last century beyond the boundaries of an artificially coherent Europe. At the same time, they reexamine the historical relationships between anarchism and communism without starting from the position of sectarian difference; rather, they look at how anarchism and communism intersected.

X-ray powder diffraction is a technique used to fingerprint solid samples, which are then identified and cataloged for future use-much the way the FBI keeps fingerprints on file. The current database of some 70,000 material prints has been put to a broad range of uses, from the analysis of moon rocks to testing drugs for purity.<br> <br> Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffractometry fully updates the achievements in the field over the past fifteen years and provides a much-needed explanation of the state-of-the-art techniques involved in characterizing materials. It covers the latest instruments and methods, with an emphasis on the fundamentals of the diffractometer, its components, alignment, calibration, and automation.<br> <br> The first three chapters outline diffraction theory in clear language, accessible to both students and professionals in chemistry, physics, geology, and materials science. The book's middle chapters describe the instrumentation and procedures used in X-ray diffraction, including X-ray sources, X-ray detection, and production of monochromatic radiation. The chapter devoted to instrument design and calibration is followed by an examination of specimen preparation methods, data collection, and reduction. The final two chapters provide in-depth discussions of qualitative and quantitative analysis.<br> <br> While the material is presented in an orderly progression, beginning with basic concepts and moving on to more complex material, each chapter stands on its own and can be studied independently or used as a professional reference. More than 230 illustrations and tables demonstrate techniques and clarify complex material.<br> <br> Self-contained, timely, and user-friendly, Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffractometry is an enormously useful text and professional reference for analytical chemists, physicists, geologists and materials scientists, and upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in materials science and analytical chemistry.<br> <br> X-ray powder diffraction-a technique that has matured significantly in recent years-is used to identify solid samples and determine their composition by analyzing the so-called "fingerprints" they generate when X-rayed. This unique volume fulfills two major roles: it is the first textbook devoted solely to X-ray powder diffractometry, and the first up-to-date treatment of the subject in 20 years.<br> <br> This timely, authoritative volume features:<br> * Clear, concise descriptions of both theory and practice-including fundamentals of diffraction theory and all aspects of the diffractometer<br> * A treatment that reflects current trends toward automation, covering the newest instrumentation and automation techniques<br> * Coverage of all the most common applications, with special emphasis on qualitative and quantitative analysis<br> * An accessible presentation appropriate for both students and professionals<br> * More than 230 tables and illustrations<br> <br> Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffractometry, a collaboration between two internationally known and respected experts in the field, provides invaluable guidance to anyone using X-ray powder diffractometers and diffractometry in materials science, ceramics, the pharmaceutical industry, and elsewhere.</p><p>Illustrated with a significant amount of useful figures and diagrams this volume contains all of the fundamentals required to understand the theory and practice of powder diffraction with a strong emphasis on the two most important applications: qualitative and quantitative analysis.Ron Jenkins is General Manager at the International Centre for Diffraction Data in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania.

Its appearance in paperback provides an opportunity for a clear appraisal of this unique campaign and of how it defined the ancient and recurrent problems of psychological warfare to suit the needs of the moment. There are chapters on policy, personnel, media, methods of operation, and effectiveness, as well as reproductions of typical propaganda leaflets, charts, and newspapers used against the Germans. For those who still debate the effects of the Allied "unconditional surrender" policy on the German people, Dr. Lerner offers discussion from a propagandist's point of view. The book also contains an essay from the British side by Richard H. S. Crossman.In a new introduction to the book, the author remarks on the importance of the Sykewar campaign for modern warfare, while William E. Griffith summarizes developments in the use of propaganda since World War II&#x2015;particularly regarding Cold War policies that have necessitated a shift in the focus of psychological warfare from the masses to the elites.</p><p></p><h2>On the Art of Drawing (Dover Art Instruction)</h2><p>With this helpful and informative guide, a leading American illustrator offers insights into how serious beginners can become sketch masters.

The evolution of the Romanians in the century between the 1770s and the 1860s was marked by a transition from long-established agrarian economic and social structures, locked into an essentially medieval political system, to a society moulded by urban and industrial values and held together by allegiance to the nation-state. This fascinating analysis of the building of a European nation-state is the first detailedf account of the Romanians during this dramatic period.<br></p><p>The century from the 1774 Treaty of Kuchuk Kainardji (between Russia and the Ottoman Empire) to the end of Prince Alexandru Cuza&#39;s reign in 1866 stands as a distinct era in the development of modern Romania. It marks the transition from long-established agrarian economic and social structures, and medieval political forms, to a society moulded by urban and industrial values and held together by allegiance to the nation-state. This initial period of nation-building was characterized by dramatic shifts of mentality and significant changes in economic and social life. The principal changes included: the freeing of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia from Ottoman Turkish dominion and their union to form the core of modern Romania; the cultivation of the idea of the ethnic nation as the foundation of community; the emergence of new ways of producing goods and doing business, notably the advance of capitalism in agriculture and industry; and the relentless advance of Western political forms, economic models and cultural achievements. This original and ground-breaking work is the first attempt to treat the period 1774-1866 as a distinct stage in the evolution of modern Romania and is a fascinating analysis of the building of a European nation-state.Keith Hitchins is Professor of History at the University of Illinois.</p><h2>Engaging Troubling Students: A Constructivist Approach</h2><p>Filled with rich narrative and&nbsp;designed for educators&nbsp;working with troubling students each day, this insightful, practical guide leads you in developing helpful, trusting student-teacher relationships.</p><p><p>Dr. Scot Danforth is well-known leader in the growing area of Disability Studies in Education, a multidisciplinary field of educational research exploring disabilities as sociopolitical constructions and construing the disabled community as an oppressed minority group.

Edward Soja Sandercock draws on recent theoretical and political debates on gender, rate and sexuality as well as on grassroot struggles in the radically multiple cities of the late 20th Century to argue that planners have to find a way of building the new multicultural city, the Cosmopolis. Neil Smith A brilliant tour de force, an original critique no thinking planner should be without. Passionate yet coherently reasoned and lucidly written, the book advances a Utopian vision, deeply grounded in actual cases drawn from a wide variety of countries, to demonstrate how multicultural urban communities can achieve justice in a democratic manner. Janet Abu-Lughod From polis to metropolis, men and women have continued to struggle to perfect our cities. Urban history presents a picture of grand ideals and devastating failures. Towards Cosmopolis explores why we have failed, and how we could succeed, in building an urban Utopia - with a difference. Globalization, civil society, feminism and post-colonialism are the forces, ever shifting and changing, which are shaping our cities. We need a new vision to face such change. Sandercock pulls down the pillars of modernist city planning and raises in their place a new post-modern planning, a planning sensitive to community, environment and cultural diversity. Towards Cosmopolis is illustrated with case material from around the world - which present &#39;a thousand tiny empowerments&#39; of current planning practice - and with a superb range of specially commissioned images. This bold critique cuts to the heart of current debates about the future of our cities. It deserves a place on every citizen&#39;s shelf.Leonie Sandercock is Professor and Chair of the Department of Landscape, Environment &amp; Planning at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.</p><h2>Theatre of Movement and Gesture</h2><p><p>Published in France in 1987, this is the book in which Lecoq first set out his philosophy of human movement, and the way it takes expressive form in a wide range of different performance traditions. He traces the history of pantomime, sets out his definition of the components of the art of mime, and discusses the explosion of physical theatre in the second half of the twentieth century. Interviews with major theatre practitioners Ariane Mnouchkine and Jean-Louis Barrault by Jean Perret, together with chapters by Perret on �tienne Decroux and Marcel Marceau, fill out the historical material written by Lecoq, and a final section by Alain Gautr� celebrates the many physical theatre practitioners working in the 1980s.</p></p><p>Royal Holloway, University of London, UK"...this is an important addition to the growing body of scholarship treating Lecoq's work, and any student of 20th-century theatre or the use of movement in performance will find this book invaluable." --<em>TDR</em></p><h2>Hot Point Fitness: The Revolutionary New Program For Fast And Total Body Transformation</h2><p>By studying the body in motion through advanced MRI technology, trainer-to-the-stars Steve Zim has determined that most of us use only 20 to 40 percent of our muscle capability when we work out. <i>Hot Point Fitness</i> introduces readers to over one hundred of Zim's unique super-exercises, demonstrating routines that will exact 100 percent output for leaner and denser muscle in a fraction of the time standard weight training and aerobic exercise take to get results.A complete plan for total body transformation, <i>Hot Point Fitness</i> also advises on the right foods to fuel the body and manipulate metabolism and it instructs on the most efficient way burn stubborn fat and calories. Focusing on precision in movement and on exercise and diet variation, Steve Zim encourages readers throughout with instructive photographs and day-by-day beginner, intermediate, and advanced workout routines. A revolutionary program that has worked wonders for professional and Olympic athletes and Hollywood actors alike, <i>Hot Point Fitness</i> will help readers of all shapes, sizes and ages realize a dramatic physical transformation in far less time than has been possible before.</p><p><i>Hot Point Fitness</i> author Steve Zim is a personal trainer/gym owner who has "a small army" of personal trainers that uses his method. Zim personally trains mostly celebrities and professional athletes, especially Olympic figure skaters and professional baseball players. His clients aim for optimal physical appearance as well as physical performance. Their sports depend on strength, agility, flexibility, and speed. According to Zim, you can achieve your own best personal fitness level by using the <i>Hot Point Fitness</i> program. The goal: to transform your body into the best shape ever.<p> The main difference between <i>Hot Point Fitness</i> and most fitness books is intensity and structure. Zim leads you through each workout, much like your own personal trainer would. "Hot Point Weight Training is designed to work each muscle to 100 percent of its capacity, and consequently completely transform the way the muscles in your body look," writes Zim. "The point of Hot Point Nutrition is to speed the metabolism and make it burn calories at a white-hot pace. Hot Point Aerobics will super-heat your muscles, and burn fat from your body quickly, safely, and forever," he says.</p><p> Zim's program is precisely structured and divided into three 28-day phases. During phase 1, you become a regular exerciser by spending one hour at the gym, three days per week. Phase 2 keeps you in the gym for 90 minutes, four days per week, and gets you to the point of "needing" to exercise. Phase 3--up to two hours a day at the gym, five days per week--brings you to an athlete's level of fitness (strength, flexibility, and endurance).</p><p> Zim developed his weight-training exercises by using MRI technology and infrared imaging to examine which muscles work during which exercises, and how hard. He was amazed to learn that traditional weight-training exercises only work 20 to 30 percent of the targeted muscles. He altered exercises and perfected techniques to build muscle density (not necessarily muscle mass), optimally by working muscles to exhaustion.</p><p> Zim describes the exercises clearly, with plenty of attention to technique. Each is illustrated by several photographs, which vary in quality (sometimes the lighting or clothing color doesn't provide enough contrast between model and background). Experienced exercisers will find almost all the exercises familiar, but will learn much from the technique recommendations that make the difference between a humdrum workout and an effective, muscle-blasting one. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>Personal trainer <b>Steve Zim</b> has worked with Hollywood stars, professional baseball players and boxers, and Olympic hopefuls.

This book, argued from a perspective shaped by postmodernism, is at once an accessible guide to and an engagement with various methods, theories, and critical practices transforming biblical scholarship today. <br><br>Written by a collective of cutting-edge scholars&#x2015;with each page the work of multiple hands&#x2015;<i>The Postmodern Bible</i> deliberately breaks with the individualist model of authorship that has traditionally dominated scholarship in the humanities and is itself an illustration of the postmodern transformation of biblical studies for which it argues.<br><br>The book introduces, illustrates, and critiques seven prominent strategies of reading. Several of these interpretive strategies&#x2015;rhetorical criticism, structuralism and narratology, reader-response criticism, and feminist criticism&#x2015;have been instrumental in the transformation of biblical studies up to now. Many&#x2015;feminist and womanist criticism, ideological criticism, poststructuralism, and psychoanalytic criticism&#x2015;hold promise for the continued transformation of these studies in the future. Focusing on readings from both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, this volume illuminates the current multidisciplinary debates emerging from postmodernism by exposing the still highly contested epistemological, political, and ethical positions in the field of biblical studies.<br></p></p><p></p><h2>Project Management: Achieving Competitive Advantage</h2><p><b> </b> <i>Project Management</i> employs a managerial, business-oriented approach to the management of projects, which is reinforced throughout the text with current examples of project management in action. <br> <b> </b> Introduction: Why Project Management?; The Organizational Context: Strategy, Structure, and Culture; Project Selection and Portfolio Management; Leadership and the Project Manager; Scope Management; Project Team Building, Conflict, and Negotiation; Risk Management; Cost Estimation and Budgeting; Project Scheduling: Networks, Duration Estimation, and Critical Path; Project Scheduling: Lagging, Crashing, and Activity Networks; Critical Chain Project Scheduling; Resource Management; Project Evaluation and Control; Project Closeout and Termination<br> <b> </b>For readers or future mangers interested in understanding the fundamentals of project management from a variety of business applications and examples. <br> <br></p><p></p><h2>The Philosophy in Christianity (Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplements, Series Number 25)</h2><p>This collection examines the central doctrines of Christianity and the ways in which, in the formulation of these doctrines, Christians have drawn on philosophical ideas.</p><p></p><h2>Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Bioethical Issues</h2><p><b>Taking Sides</b> volumes present current controversial issues in a debate-style format designed to stimulate student interest and develop critical thinking skills.

English anthropologists Stringer and Gamble hope to settle the controversy over the Neanderthals' proper branch on humanity's family tree by taking their case to a general audience. They marshall the evidence in favor of the "Out of Africa 2" scenario, contending that Neanderthal populations in Europe and the Middle East were replaced by a second African migration between 130,000 and 50,000 years ago. Neanderthals, therefore, are not directly ancestral to modern humans. The authors make a strong case for their interpretations, but they offer little more than a caricature of competing theories. Still, this is an important and readable book, with many good illustrations. Recommended for academic and public libraries.<br><i>- Eric Hinsdale, Trinity Univ.

For Finland, Aalto, through his architecture, furniture, glassware and sculpture, contributed perhaps more than any other Finn to the creation of the cultural identity of the new independent Finland and its promotion around the world. His Finnish Pavilions in Paris and New York from the Thirties placed Finland centre-stage, establishing its identity as a modern, innovative country and generated huge interest in this northern land of lakes and forests. He went on to work in 18 countries around the world, as well as designing many of Finland&#x2019;s most important buildings of the 50s, 60s and 70s.<br> <br>This new biography of Aalto is the first to comprehensively cover his life, from the backwoods of Ostrabothnia to international fame and all of his buildings, from the early alterations and extensions to shops and houses in Jyvaskyla to Finlandia Hall. It draws on Aalto&#x2019;s archive, recollections of former employees and contemporaneous publications to fully explore Alvar Aalto the architect, rather than simply Alvar Aalto&#x2019;s architecture. For the first time, his life is set in the context of the events that surrounded and shaped it the Finnish Civil War, the Great Depression, The Winter and Continuation Wars, the post-war boom in education, Finland&#x2019;s industrialisation and eventually the social revolution of the 60s which led to his characterization as a member of a Finnish elite and temporary unpopularity. It covers his life from his childhood, growing up in regional Jyvaskyla and Alajarvi, his architectural studies in Helsinki, combat in the Civil War through to the founding of his first office, his early neo-classical work and his international breakthrough with the completion of Paimio Sanatorium and Viipuri Library. It deals with his personal life, his marriage to Aino, what working life in his first office was like, the architectural competitions, his key friendships and continuous financial difficulties. As his career progressed, it explores the patrons who were so important to him the Gullichsens and the founding of Artek, his new American friends, professorship at MIT. After the war, the death of Aino, marriage to Elissa and the period of his greatest architectural achievements - Saynatsalo Town Hall, Otaniemi University and Imatra Church. It considers the organisation of his new office in Helsinki, his expanding team, fame and eventually vanity. The book seeks to understand what drove him, the combination of skills, talents and character traits, which led to his extraordinary global success.<br>As you will be aware, there is no shortage of books on Alvar Aalto, or to be more precise, there is no shortage of books on Alvar Aalto&#x2019;s Architecture. (Only one previous biography exists, published first in 1984 and now out of print). This book is about an architect and his architecture, written by another architect, not an architectural historian. It is the first, frank and fully-comprehensive biography of Alvar Aalto.<br></p><p>Richard Rogers is the 2007 Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureate, the recipient of the RIBA Gold Medal in 1985 and winner of the 1999 Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation Medal.

This is the first book to analyze the development of a noble following during the whole course of the Wars of Religion. The Guise were one of the greatest families of Christendom and this is the first substantial work on them for a century. In Normandy, a stronghold of Protestantism, they built a formidable ultra-Catholic party that ultimately challenged the monarchy. This book breaks new ground by discussing all groups in political society, from international dynastic politics to peasant revolt.</p><p>"The author provides valuable insights into Guisard activities on the national level, such as the St. Bartholomew's Massacre and efforts on behalf of their kinswoman, Mary Stuart. Based on extensive archival research, this book should lead to a reconsideration of the Guise role in the religious wars." Choice<br><br>"[Carroll's] book rests on a remarkable body of archival research and on an unmatched reconstruction of specific political happenings; and it gives unusually close attention to the lesser lights among the Guise, alongside the acknowledged stars.

When "offworlders" return, their superior technology upsets the balance of a developing civilization. <i>Mission Child</i> follows the journeys of Janna after she and her young partner escape marauders who attack their hometown. The girl, fast becoming mature beyond her years, sets off across the planet on an odyssey of adventure, poverty, hard work, war, famine, and rebirth. Janna uses her meager skills to eke out a living in a changing world; she gains and loses a husband, a child, friends, jobs, and more. </p><p> McHugh weaves together anthropology, sociology, psychology, and gender relations in this wondrous journey. Janna assumes the guise of a boy for protection, but eventually becomes "Jan" to herself as well as others. Reminiscent of Ursula K.

It involves the efforts of record company producers and executives, club owners, concert promoters, festival organizers, musicologists, agents and managers, editors and writers - and, of course, musicians and audiences. <br><br>In <em>Folk City</em>, authors Stephen Petrus and Ron Cohen capture the exuberance of the times and introduce readers to a host of characters who brought a new style to the biggest audience in the history of popular music. Among the savvy New York entrepreneurs committed to promoting folk music were Izzy Young of the Folklore Center, Mike Porco of Gerde's Folk City, and John Hammond of Columbia Records. While these and other businessmen developed commercial networks for musicians, the performance venues provided the artists space to test their mettle. The authors portray Village coffee houses not simply as lively venues but as incubators of a burgeoning counterculture, where artists from diverse backgrounds honed their performance techniques and challenged social conventions. Accessible and engaging, fresh and provocative, rich in anecdotes and primary sources, <em>Folk City</em> is lavishly illustrated with images collected for the accompanying major exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York in 2015.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Petrus</strong> is an Andrew W. Mellon Research Fellow at the New-York Historical Society, where he is working on his second book, a political and cultural history of Greenwich Village in the 1950s and 60s. At the Museum of the City of New York, he curated the exhibition Folk City, on view until January 10th, 2016, and was co-author of the show's accompanying book, with historian Ronald D. Cohen. Petrus has published essays on twentieth-century U.S. urban and cultural history. He received his Ph.D. in history from the City University Graduate Center and taught at Lehman College in the Bronx. He currently lives in Brooklyn.<br><br><strong>Ronald D. Cohen</strong> is Emeritus Professor of History at Indiana University Northwest in Gary, Indiana. He is the author of numerous books on the history of folk music including <em>The Pete Seeger Reader </em>(OUP, 2014) and was the co-producer/writer of the 10-CD boxed set <em>Songs for Political Action: Folk</em> <em>Music, Topical Songs and the American Left</em>, 1926-1954 (1996).<br><br>"<em>Folk City</em> is a magical token back to a clattering, incandescent New York, where Popular Front hootenannies gave way to the fretted hip of Gerde's, the Gaslight, and the Folklore Center. Stephen Petrus and Ronald Cohen have written the best history yet of the city's influential folk music culture, packed with astonishing photos that finally see the light of day." --Sean Wilentz, author of <em>Bob Dylan in America</em><p></p><br>"Yes, dear readers, there was a time not so long ago when urban troubadours sang of flowers more powerful than guns; a time when ideals put to song helped transform a culture. With compelling artistry, Stephen Petrus and Ronald Cohen capture the history behind that special moment and how New York's diverse creative class made it happen." --Thomas Kessner, Distinguished Professor of History, City University of New York Graduate School<p></p><br>"<em>Folk City</em> is beautifully written and illustrated, a mesmerizing history of one of the great moments in New York cultural history. The prose fairly sings off the page, and the photos and old poster and song sheets are fascinating. This will make you wish you were there." --Kevin Baker, author of <em>The</em> <em>Big Crowd</em><p></p><br>"This handsome book, which includes rarely seen photographs, reminiscences of participants and a lively narrative . . . The authors do a fine job of presenting the various facets of the folk revival, including its impact on the city and its role in changing the larger culture." --<em>The New York</em> <em>Times</em><p></p><br>"Fourteen years ago, author David Hajdu crafted a superb, perhaps definitive, portrait of Greenwich Village at the height of the folk-music revival . . . yet in [<em>FOLK CITY'S</em>] winningly plain-spoken way, provides a far more comprehensive appreciation of one of the most colourful chapters in American music." -- Maclean's<p></p><br>"[A] fresh, colorful, thoroughly illustrated portrait of the scene, from its origins to today . . . [<em>FOLK CITY</em>] is particularly compelling in chronicling, from original documents and firsthand testimony, how the critical mass for the folk revival congregated in the city."--<em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Petrus (curatorial fellow, Museum of the City of New York) and Cohen (emer., history, Indiana Univ. Northwest) have produced a wonderful overview of the influential folk music scene that revolved around New York City's Greenwich Village and Washington Square during the 1950s and 1960s."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"Reading <em>Folk City</em> is almost like watching a film documentary (of which there have been a few) of that time. But in its balanced yet passionate story it helps one recreate memories, re-think thoughts, laugh at some of the foolishness, and weep for some of the tragedies...[it] will bring you as close as you can get to a very wonderful time that is still re-creating itself in the guitar strummers of today."--<em>The Bridge</em><p></p><br>"Straightforward and engaging, breezily fresh and poignant, rich in reminiscences and primary as well as secondary sources, <em>Folk City: New York and the American Folk Music Revival</em> is the inviting companion publication to the Museum of the City of New York's similarly titled exhibit."--<em>Sing Out!</em><p></p><br>"<em>Folk City</em> began life as a companion essay to a recent exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York. It comes close to being a complete social history of a vital, but ultimately tragic moment."--<em>The Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"<em>Folk City</em>...is a striking mix...an impressive job of research readably and sometimes eloquently presented."--<em>Journal of Folklore Research</em><p></p><br>"No pair was better placed to mount the exhibition or to write the accompanying, beautiful book..."--<em>Journal of Popular Music Studies</em><p></p><br>"Petrus and Cohen's <em>Folk City</em> offers a fascinating and highly readable account of the American folk music revival, which they effectively argue came about as an extension of New York City's unique cultural scenery."--The Gotham Center for New York City History<p></p><br>"[An] impressive volume, impeccably presented and lucidly written..."--<em>Popular Music</em><p></p><br>"Petrus and Cohen know the story that they want to tell, and they tell it well. They are at their best when tracing the connections between underground performance venues, music magazine publishers, and moments of social activism, and they lead their audience fluently through the networks of music and politics that made up the New York folk music scene. Readers who are interested in New York City will find new layers to the city's cultural life to appreciate, and readers who are folk music lovers will discover the extent of that music's impact on American society."--<em>Notes</em><p></p><br>"<em>Folk City</em> provides several valuable scholarly contributions. For one, it is strong in detail and offers a definitive account of the evolution of folk music during the middle part of the twentieth century. The authors also effectively highlight the reasons why New York City helped precipitate a folk music revival. As such, the book is not simply a descriptive narrative; rather, it connects factual detail to wider themes and ideas. Petrus and Cohen also make several interesting connections to urban history that situate their arguments within a wider historical framework...<em>Folk City</em> is an excellent book, important not only as a history of folk music but as a significant contribution to urban history as well." --<em>Popular Music and Society</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Bonsai Book: The Definitive Illustrated Guide</h2><p><b>This beautiful, full-color, authoritative book presents, in a practical yet inspirational way, Dan Barton&#x2019;s expert knowledge and two decades of research on the joy of Bonsai.

For the creativity of his thinking, the originator of Archetypal Psychology and author of A Terrible Love of War; The Soul&#39;s Code; and The Force of Character has received many honors, including the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic. He has held distinguished lectureships at Yale, Princeton, Chicago, and Syracuse Universities, and his books have been translated into some twenty languages. The American public showed its appreciation of his approach to psychology by placing his book, The Soul&#39;s Code, at the top of the bestseller list of serious works of nonfiction. Of his many books, Spring Publications has published Anima, Loose Ends, Archetypal Psychology: A Brief Account, Pan and the Nightmare, Suicide and the Soul, Insearch, Oedipus Variations (with Karl Ker�nyi), The Thought of the Heart and the Soul of the World, Inter Views, and Lectures on Jung&#39;s Typology (with Marie-Louise von Franz). He lives in Connecticut.Insearch: Psychology and Religion is one of the few enduring descriptions of Jungian therapy in its relation to religion. In four insightful chapters (The Human Encounter, The Unconscious as Experience, The Inner Morality of the Shadow, and The Inner Feminine or Anima) James Hillman gives a comprehensive account of Jungian psychology. His examples are fresh, his language easy, and the evident pleasure he takes in opening the great questions of the soul make Insearch a basic text and seminal work, an introduction to psychotherapy and a consistently quoted reference for pastoral counseling. --<i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>When the Moon was Blue</h2><p>Literacy 2000 Stage 4 Set E -- When the Moon Was Blue (P) Written by Joy Cowley / Illustrated by Kelvin Hawley ***ISBN-13: 9780790101637 ***Pages: 24</p><p></p><h2>Castro, Marine Science, 2016, 1e, Student Edition (AP MARINE SCIENCE)</h2><p>A great introductory text about marine science.</p><p>Michael E.

In the process, they are changing the scope of their business operations, redrawing their organization charts, redefining the allocation of decision-making authority and responsibility, revamping the mechanisms for motivating and rewarding people, reconsidering which activities to conduct in-house and which to out-source, redesigning their information systems, and seeking to alter the shared beliefs, values and norms that their people hold. In this book, John Roberts argues that there are predictable, necessary relationships among these changes that will improve performance and growth. The organizations that are successful will establish patterns of fit among the elements of their organizational designs, their competitive strategies and the external environment in which they operate and will go about this in a holistic manner. <em>The Modern Firm</em> develops powerful conceptual frameworks for analyzing the interrelations between organizational design features, competitive strategy and the business environment. Written in a non-technical language, the book is nevertheless based on rigorous modeling and draws on numerous examples from the eighteenth century fur trading companies to such modern firms such as BP and Nokia. Finally, the book explores why these developments are happening now, pointing to the increase in global competition and changes in technology. Written by one of the world's leading economists and experts on business strategy and organization, <em>The Modern Firm</em> provides new insights into the changes going on in business today and will be of interest to academics, students and managers alike.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Roberts</strong> holds the John H. and Irene S.

Simmons</p><p>Mired in poverty, the student Raskolnikov nevertheless thinks well of himself. Of his pawnbroker he takes a different view, and in deciding to do away with her he sets in motion his own tragic downfall. Dostoyevsky&#39;s penetrating novel of an intellectual whose moral compass goes haywire, and the detective who hunts him down for his terrible crime, is a stunning psychological portrait, a thriller and a profound meditation on guilt and retribution.CRIME AND PUNISHMENT <br>By Fyodor Dostoevsky <br>Translated By Constance Garnett</p><h2>Black Patriots and Loyalists: Fighting for Emancipation in the War for Independence</h2><p>We commonly think of the American Revolution as simply the war for independence from British colonial rule. But, of course, that independence actually applied to only a portion of the American population&#x2014;African Americans would still be bound in slavery for nearly another century. Alan Gilbert asks us to rethink what we know about the Revolutionary War, to realize that while white Americans were fighting for their freedom, many black Americans were joining the British imperial forces to gain theirs. Further, a movement led by sailors&#x2014;both black and white&#x2014;pushed strongly for emancipation on the American side. There were actually two wars being waged at once: a political revolution for independence from Britain and a social revolution for emancipation and equality.<br><br>Gilbert presents persuasive evidence that slavery could have been abolished during the Revolution itself if either side had fully pursued the military advantage of freeing slaves and pressing them into combat, and his extensive research also reveals that free blacks on both sides played a crucial and underappreciated role in the actual fighting. <i>Black Patriots and Loyalists </i>contends that the struggle for emancipation was not only basic to the Revolution itself, but was a rousing force that would inspire freedom movements like the abolition societies of the North and the black loyalist pilgrimages for freedom in Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone.</p><p><p></p><b>Alan Gilbert</b> is a John Evans Professor in the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. He is the author of <i>Marx&#x2019;s Politics: Communists and Citizens</i>, <i>Democratic Individuality</i>, and <i>Must Global Politics Constrain Democracy?</i><i></i>He lives with his wife, Paula, and their son, Sage, in the mountains of Morrison, Colorado.&#x201c;Most of us think we know the story of the American Revolution, but after reading Alan Gilbert&#x2019;s amazing book I realize that what most of us know is less than half of the story. Gilbert&#x2019;s account rests on years of careful research, and on the ability to keep track of events whose actors were moved by complex and often contradictory motives.&nbsp;Gilbert shows that there were two revolutions going on in the American colonies at the same time: the revolution for independence, that succeeded, and a black revolution for emancipation whose goal was not achieved until decades later. And Gilbert shows how the consequences of the &#x201c;forgotten&#x201d; black revolution extended far beyond those years, and beyond American shores, to Canada, to Sierra Leone in Africa, as well as to the liberation of Haiti from France, and reinforced the struggle for abolition of slavery in the British Empire that was to succeed in 1833. This is an important book as well as an attractively written example of significant and morally engaged scholarship.&#x201d; (Hilary Putnam, Harvard University)<br><br>&#x201c;Alan Gilbert has written an important book on the &#x2018;revolution within the revolution.&#x2019; In his stirring narrative of the black freedom struggle, history from below meets intellectual history, and African-American workers emerge as agents, not only in the American Revolution, but in an Atlantic movement for democracy and equality in the Age of Revolution.&#x201d; (Marcus Rediker, University of Pittsburgh)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Alan Gilbert has deftly welded together the white American political revolution for independence with the black American social revolution for freedom from slavery.&nbsp;In exploiting a wide range of primary sources, he has given voice to the thousands of enslaved (and sometimes free) blacks who sought &#x2018;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&#x2019; with the British.&nbsp;Gilbert&#x2019;s&nbsp;signal contribution to the fraught question of how many blacks fled to the British compels the attention of every student of the American Revolution.&#x201d;</p> (Gary Nash, The Unknown American Revolution: The Unruly Birth of Democracy and the Struggle to Create America)<br><br>&#x201c;A first generation of historians of the American Revolution &#x2018;from the bottom up&#x2019; wrote about poor people who were mostly white, such as artisans, sailors, and tenant farmers.&nbsp; In this eloquent book Alan Gilbert exemplifies a second group of scholars who direct our attention to more oppressed and vulnerable groups, namely&nbsp;Native Americans and&nbsp;slaves.&nbsp; Writing with unprecedented detail, Gilbert demolishes the myth that it&nbsp;is &#x2018;anachronistic&#x2019; to insist that the Founding Fathers should have applied the preamble of the Declaration of Independence to&nbsp;the bondage of approximately 600,000 African Americans.&nbsp; Their failure to rise to that challenge led to the deaths of more than 600,000 Union and Confederate soldiers&nbsp;before this great&nbsp;wrong was righted by civil war.&#x201d; (Staughton Lynd, author of Intellectual Origins of American Radicalism)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Drawing on first-person accounts and other primary sources, Gilbert tells an often inspiring but ultimately sad story, since American slavery endured and even expanded after the revolution. Still, the personal stories of those who fought on the patriots&#x2019; side in an all-black regiment and on the loyalist side in exchange for a promise of freedom are fascinating and informative. Gilbert convincingly asserts that their example eventually helped inspire other liberation movements in the Western Hemisphere.&#x201d;</p><p></p> (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"Gilbert's book melds political, military, and intellectual history to provide a well-rounded depiction of this issue. . . .

While there are some general mental health effects of sexual violence, this book outlines and describes the impact of particular types of sexual violation. Whether the survivor has experienced childhood sexual abuse, sexual assault during adulthood, marital rape, sexual harassment, sex trafficking, or sexual violence within the military, they will find aspects of her experience in these pages. Once survivors understand the ways in which they have been affected, they are introduced to various pathways to surviving sexual violence and moving forward. The chapters provide case examples and specific activities which give a fuller description of the ways survivors can make use of the particular approaches, which include mind-body practices, counseling, group therapies, self-defense training, and others. Anyone who has been a victim of sexual violence, or knows and cares about someone who has, will find relief in these pages, which offer practical approaches to finding balance and healing.</p><p>Thema Bryant-Davis is associate professor of psychology at Pepperdine University, where she also is director of the Culture and Trauma Research Lab. Bryant-Davis, a former American Psychological Association representative to the United Nations and former President of the Society for the Psychology of Women, is author of Thriving in the Wake of Trauma: A Multicultural Guide which won an Academic Choice Award. She was also awarded the Emerging Leader of Women in Psychology Award. She was elected a member of the Committee on Women in Psychology of the American Psychological Association. She is an associate editor for Psychological Trauma, the premiere APA journal on traumatic stress and recovery. She is a trainer for rape crisis centers nationally and internationally and has provided training for mental health professionals, medical personnel, judges, police officers, religious leaders, and community members on sexual violence prevention and intervention.The premise of Bryant-Davis&#x2019;s (psychology, Pepperdine Univ.) book is that while survivors of sexual violence often develop mental health issues, they can still grow and live full lives. A victim of sexual assault, Bryant-Davis empathetically explains the range of different sexual violations, from harassment in the workplace and marital rape to sexual violence in the military and childhood sexual abuse. She draws from experts in the field to shed light on various modes of recovery including mind-body practices, psychoeducation, spirituality/religion, and journaling. Bryant offers comprehensive treatment options for practitioners and readers familiar with the field. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>In this comprehensive anthology on coping with sexual violence, psychology professor and trauma expert Bryant-Davis (Thriving in the Wake of Trauma) has included essays covering childhood sexual abuse, human trafficking, the value of self-defense training, and the reintegration of faith as a method of healing from trauma, among other subjects. The result reads... free of academic jargon, and accessible to laypeople. Sexual abuse survivors, as well as their friends and family, will find suggestions for recovery strategies and supporting research. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>At the same time that it disrupts lives, sexual violence can also offer options for survival and growth. That is the overall message Bryant-Davis (psychology, Pepperdine Univ.) delivers in this edited volume, which focuses mostly on adult women. Part 1 describes sexual violence across the life span and settings (e.g., harassment, trafficking, relationships--sexual assault in the military is considered) and the plethora of physical, psychological, and spiritual outcomes resulting from that violence. Part 2 emphasizes culturally sensitive counseling to empower survivors and aid recovery--for example, psychotherapy, eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing, family therapy, feminist counseling, mind-body practices (which are particularly helpful for women), journaling, and social support in general. Vignettes illuminate pathways to healing and coping skills, self-defense training, spirituality, and group and individual therapy. Psychoeducation involves dispelling myths and providing education about sexual assault....This book is useful for survivors, significant others, and counselors seeking a broad array of positive and supportive interventions. Resources and suggested activities are helpful. Summing Up: Recommended. Researchers, professionals, and general readers.

Many different aspects of sexual violence are explored. Treatment techniques are discussed in both technical and practical terms for both professionals and survivors to gain knowledge and benefit. (<i>PsycCRITIQUES</i>)<br><br>This comprehensive guide contains a wealth of information about various forms of sexual violence and a range of treatments and recovery methods for sexual assault survivors. The book is remarkable in its clarity and accessibility and coverage of current research, making it a wonderful resource for professionals, students, and survivors. (Sarah E. Ullman, Ph.D., professor of criminology,law, &amp; justice, University of Illinois at Chicago)<br><br>Although the effects of sexual violation can be long-term and severe, healing is possible. Unfortunately, few culturally sensitive resources are designed to help victims, their loved ones, and service providers negotiate the healing process. <i>Surviving Sexual Violence: A Guide to Recovery and Empowerment</i> fills a critically important void. In conjunction with a stellar panel of experts, Thema Bryant-Davis uses a warm tone, professional knowledge, and personal experience to create an inspiring, comprehensive overview of sexual victimization. The authors offer clear explanations, practical suggestions, and many moving first-person examples of the recovery process drawn from interviews with survivors. Written in accessible language, this book will offer hope and encouragement to a broad range of survivors. It is also suitable for training mental health clinicians and researchers as well as experienced professionals. In addition to providing clear, practical suggestions and explanations, <i>Surviving Sexual Violence: A Guide to Recovery and Empowerment</i> has other important features: o In addition to sexual assaults by strangers, intimate parents, and family members, it acknowledges the victimization of survivors of human trafficking, military rape, and group rape. o It takes a holistic approach to healing by including the mind, body, and spirit of the survivors. They are encouraged to explore spirituality, meditation, journaling, and activism as additional pathways to healing. Definitive in scope, <i>Surviving Sexual Violence: A Guide to Recovery and Empowerment</i> will help professionals and others who are invested in helping survivors come to terms with the past, while moving into a promising future. (Carolyn M. West Ph.D, University of Washington)<br><br>As the founder of a multi-national nonprofit and outspoken survivor of sexual assault, I know firsthand the importance of the profound journey from victim, to survivor, to thriver. Surviving Sexual Violence: A Guide to Recovery and Empowerment is a comprehensive roadmap of the complex issues of sexual violence and the inspirational messaging that our past need not define us. Not only is healing possible, but it is probable if we shatter the silence of sexual violence! (Angela Rose, founder and executive director, PAVE: Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment)<br><br>This book will help educate and empower survivors of sexual violation to work through the healing process. Sexual violation affects survivors but does not have to dictate their future, and this book shows readers how various paths to healing can help them not only overcome the trauma of sexual assault, but also thrive as they move on with their lives. Contributors aim to arm the reader with access to multiple internal and external resources that can be tapped into during the recovery journey. The survivors, their families, and helping professionals will learn to identify the effects and dynamics of various forms of sexual violence so that understanding can open the door to healing.</p><h2>The Woodcut Art of J.J. Lankes (Imago Mundi)</h2><p>The work of J. J. Lankes (1884-1960) is regrettably almost forgotten today. This is unfortunate, for in addition to being a certifiable American original, Lankes was a talented artist (arguably the first genuine woodcut artist this country produced), the close friend of poets and writers, and the author of the first reliable and comprehensive book on woodcutting published in North America. This is the first and only volume devoted to his fascinating career, one that highlights and illustrates the variety and the quality of the work he created over forty years. Reading it will be a revelation.<br><br>Lankes worked exclusively in the East, and his woodcuts, mostly of scenery and structures, range from northern Vermont to his adopted state, Virginia, with brief excursions into New York and Pennsylvania. Commissioned on a regular basis to illustrate books, he created a number of enduring images, his most famous certainly being the ones used to adorn Robert Frost's poetry. These and the glorious woodcuts he published of Virginia were probably his crowning achievement, but this retrospective contains a complete overview of his work, including his Christmas cards, illustrations of weather sayings, Bucks County stone barns, and his inventive ephemera.<br><br>In The Woodcut Art of J. J. Lankes, Welford Dunaway Taylor has painted a rich portrait of a crotchety, unconventional and neglected American artist, and also provided an extensive bibliography of Lankes's published work as well as a collation of his prints. This book, if there is any justice, will restore Lankes s reputation as one of America's foremost graphic artists.</p><p>Welford Taylor holds the James A.

Even though al-Qaeda's leadership has been largely destroyed and its organization disrupted, terrorist attacks take 12,000 lives annually worldwide, and jihadist terrorist ideology continues to spread. How? Largely by going online and adopting a new method of organization. Terrorist structures, traditionally consisting of loose-net cells, divisions, and subgroups, are ideally suited for flourishing on the Internet through websites, e-mail, chat rooms, e-groups, forums, virtual message boards, YouTube, Google Earth, and other outlets. Terrorist websites, including social media platforms, now number close to 10,000. <br><br>This book addresses three major questions: why and how terrorism went online; what recent trends can be discerned&#x2015;such as engaging children and women, promoting lone wolf attacks, and using social media; and what future threats can be expected, along with how they can be reduced or countered. To answer these questions, <i>Terrorism in Cyberspace</i> analyzes content from more than 9,800 terrorist websites, and Weimann, who has been studying terrorism online since 1998, selects the most important kinds of web activity, describes their background and history, and surveys their content in terms of kind and intensity, the groups and prominent individuals involved, and effects. He highlights cyberterrorism against financial, governmental, and engineering infrastructure; efforts to monitor, manipulate, and disrupt terrorists' online efforts; and threats to civil liberties posed by ill-directed efforts to suppress terrorists' online activities as future, worrisome trends.</p><p>Gabriel Weimann is professor of communication at the University of Haifa, Israel.

Susan offers exciting, practical suggestions for using familiar and new technological tools to create documentation that communicates with families and children. <br>Susan reminds us that documentation is more useful than as a display of interesting events in a classroom. With pedagogical documentation a teacher pays close attention to children&#x2019;s thinking during the process of inquiry into a topic. A teacher listens and responds as children question, explore, interact, pose theories, and investigate.<br>Susan shows us how documentation is an act of reciprocity wherein a teacher offers her response to children&#x2019;s work through photos, narration, and speculation. Documentation is collaboration&#x2015;when shared with a child it too becomes an object of study. Documentation is pedagogical practice that helps teachers reach beyond their certainties to consider what may be possible.

Despite their current illegality, many Americans are already familiar with their effects. Yet while LSD and MDMA have proven extraordinarily effective in treating anxiety disorders such as PTSD, they still remain off-limits to the millions who might benefit from them. Through the stories of three very different men, award-winning journalist Tom Shroder covers the drugs&#x2019; roller-coaster history from their initial reception in the 1950s to the negative stereotypes that persist today. At a moment when popular opinion is rethinking the potential benefits of some illegal drugs, and with new research coming out every day,&nbsp;<i>Acid Test</i>&nbsp;is a fascinating and informative must-read.<br><br></p></p><p><p><b>Tom Shroder</b> is an award-winning journalist, editor, and author of <i>Old Souls</i> and <i>Acid Test</i>, a transformative look at the therapeutic powers of psychedelic drugs in the treatment of PTSD. As editor of <i>The Washington Post Magazine</i>, he conceived and edited two Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning feature stories. His most recent editing project, <i>Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time</i>, by Brigid Schulte, was a <i>New York Times </i>best-seller.</p>Foreword<p>In 1975 I was a twenty-one-year-old college journalist, home on spring break in Sarasota, Florida, when I noticed a blurb in the local news- paper about a charismatic hippie with a pet wolf who was building himself a spectacular house in the woods near town. I decided to go out and see it for myself. I don&#x2019;t remember anything about the blurb. I doubt it mentioned anything about the inf luence of psychedelic drugs in this project. But I am guessing that I inferred it, because while I didn&#x2019;t much care about techniques of home building&#x2014;nor would my college-student readers&#x2014;I was extremely interested in the implications of the psychedelic experience.</p><p>I&#x2019;m looking at a taped-together, Xeroxed copy of the story that resulted from that visit. Still no mention of drugs, but there it is between the lines. I wrote about the philosophy of the young builder, a guy named Rick Doblin, just a year older than me. It was about try- ing to live authentically, guided by an inner light rather than society&#x2019;s preconceived ideas; consciously working to discover and create his own destiny rather than trudging along the rutted tracks set before him.</p><p>These were the kinds of notions floating around a certain subculture in those days; it was evident in the woodland home itself, with its giant, rainbow-themed, spiritually suggestive stained-glass window. Maybe we discussed psychedelics, maybe we didn't. But they were in the air.</p><p>I myself was not entirely unfamiliar. Under the influence of the psilocybin mushrooms my friends and I had learned to pluck from cow dung in the rural fields not far from campus, then boil into tea and drink, I had seen the world-and myself-from a novel vantage point.</p><p>It was like being able, for a few precious hours, to climb above your life</p><p>and view it from on high, a perspective every bit as revealing as seeing a too-familiar landscape from the top of a mountain. Instead of indi� vidual cornstalks or oak trees or buildings, you saw checkerboard pat� terns of fields, serpentine forests following the course of a river, villages arrayed around ascending spires of churches. You saw, for once, how it all fit together.</p><p>One experience stands out in my memory, because it is something that I have carried with me, every day since, for four decades. <i>As </i>the drug took effect, instead of feeling the usual lift, I grew increasingly entangled by anxiety. I began to obsess about an ethical problem I was struggling with, which generalized to feelings of inadequacy in life overall and my inability to find solutions.</p><p>The more I struggled against these feelings, the weightier and more intractable they seemed. And then s uddenly I had a vision: I saw myself with my arms wrapped around a boulder. I could feel its weight, almost unbearable to hold, and yet I was clinging to it. I knew that the heavy stone consisted of all my doubt s and anxieties, and as I desperately clutched it to my chest, I saw in a flash that part of me <i>chose </i>to be anxious-as a way to avoid making choices and evade responsibility for them. To be free of that awful weight, all I had to do was open my arms, which I did. The stone simply dropped away.</p><p>Ever since, although it has rarely been easy, I've been able to see negative emotions, on a profound level, as a choice, and the will to let them go as something I could develop, like a muscle. The more I prac�ticed, the better I got, and I no longer needed the mushrooms to do it.</p><p>There wasn't a moment I decided to stop doing psychedelic drugs. When I left the college environment they became less available, and I gained more responsibilities-a job, a family, a professional reputation� all of which made any illegal activity, and the potential health risks, unacceptable. But I never lost my interest in those psychedelic experi� ences, or forgot their profundity, and the lasting good they did me.</p><p>Ten years after graduation, I had become an editor at the <i>Miami Herald </i>Sunday magazine, <i>Tropic, </i>when I noticed a story in the Tampa newspaper about a perennial college student who was promoting the party drug Ecstasy as a breakthrough in psychotherapy. I did a double take: it was Rick Doblin, the hippie with the house in the woods, the same guy I had written about a decade earlier. I assigned a <i>Herald </i>fea� ture writer to do a cover story on him. We headlined it: ''A Timothy Leary for the '80s."</p><p>Twenty years passed. Now I was editor of <i>The Washington Post Magazine, </i>and once again an article that spoke to my lingering interest in the possible positive effects of psychedelics caught my eye. This time it was in the <i>New York Times, </i>about Harvard initiating a study testing the use of MDMA- Ecstasy- to treat anxiety and depression inter� minal cancer patients. The man sponsoring the study: a very sophisticated-sounding Harvard Kennedy School PhD named Rick <i>Doblin- the hippie in the woods.</i></p><p>I got a phone number and Rick answered. When I told him my name, he laughed. He not only remembered me and the two stories from twenty and thirty years earlier, he still had copies of them both. And just that morning, he told me, he'd held up the "Tim Leary" cover of <i>Tropic </i>at a board meeting of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), his nonprofit organization, to demon� strate how completely he'd remade his image, from a rebellious hippie to the sponsor of cutting-edge scientific research in some of the nation's more conservative institutions.</p><p>This time I wrote the story myself, focusing on the MAPS� sponsored research a psychiatrist named Michael Mithoefer was con� ducting in Charleston, South Carolina, treating with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy mostly female victims of sexual abuse. The story ap� peared in <i>The Washington Post Magazine </i>in November 2007, and much of it has been adapted here in chapter forty-two.</p><p>I was pleased enough with the piece as published, but I felt it barely scratched the surface, both because of rapidly accumulating develop� ments in psychedelic research and because I sensed that the signifi� cance of any given study could not be fully assessed without a deeper understanding of the people behind the studies, not to mention the century-long struggle of Western culture to come to grips with these powerful and, in some ways, profoundly threatening drugs.</p><p>This is what I have attempted in <i>Acid Test. </i>Whatever success I have had I owe entirely to the openness and honesty of the principal charac� ters. Those people listed in the acknowledgments have granted me access to scores of records and privileged documents and agreed to sit for what amounted to a combined total of more than a hundred hours of interviews, unflinchingly answering the most intimate and sensitive questions, revealing things that were personally painful and might very well expose them to negative judgments or significantly compli� cate their lives.</p><p>Their reasons for agreeing to all the above are transparent. They accepted my contention that the full and complete disclosure of all the information surrounding the use and abuse of psychedelic drugs, the history of psychedelic therapy, the motivations of the researchers, and the experiences of the subjects is the best argument for continued and extended support of rigorous and responsible investigation.</p><p>I owe a special debt to those among them who have undergone clinical trials to treat debilitating post-traumatic stress, a disorder that makes it particularly difficult and potentially painful to open up. In particular, I am indebted to Donna Kilgore, Tony Made, and, above all, Nicholas Blackston. They all spent hours reviewing their case his� tories with me, leaving nothing off the record, as well as giving me permission to listen to or watch voluminous audio- and videotapes of their therapeutic sessions. It is hard to imagine a more naked vulnera� bility than allowing an outsider to witness hours spent delving into your deepest, most charged and haunting intimacies explored under the powerful effect of MDMA. Yet, these people made that sacrifice willingly, for no other reason than a sense of duty. They felt the ther� apy benefited them and quite possibly saved their lives, and they believed sharing their stories might help make the therapy available to others.</p><p>I am moved and awed by their courage.</p></p><h2>No Man&#39;s Land</h2><p><p><strong>From the trenches to the home front, the most profound fiction inspired by World War I&#x2015;and a moving memorial to the twentieth century's most cataclysmic event.</strong></p><p>The Great War gave birth to some of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most celebrated writing; from D. H. Lawrence to Siegfried Sassoon, the literature generated by the war is etched into collective memory. But it is in fiction that we find some of the most profound insights into the war&#x2019;s individual and communal tragedies, the horror of life in the trenches, and the grand farce of the first industrial war.</p> Featuring forty-seven writers from twenty different nations, representing all the main participants in the conflict, <em>No Man&#x2019;s Land</em> is a truly international anthology of World War I fiction. Work by Erich Maria Remarque, Willa Cather, William Faulkner, and Rose Macaulay sits alongside forgotten masterpieces such as Stratis Myrivilis&#x2019;s <em>Life in the Tomb</em>, Raymond Escholier&#x2019;s <em>Mahmadou Fofana</em>, and Mary Borden&#x2019;s <em>The Forbidden</em><em>Zone</em>.<br><br><em>No Man&#x2019;s Land</em> is a brilliant memorial to the twentieth century&#x2019;s most cataclysmic event.</p><p>Pete Ayrton was born in London in 1943. After a brief period teaching philosophy, his work as a translator led to an editorial position and later to his founding of Serpent's Tail.&nbsp;No Man's Land,&nbsp;his collection of writings from World War I, was highly acclaimed on both sides of the Atlantic and was named one of the&nbsp;Economist's Books of the Year.&#x201c;Ayrton has achieved something very rare and powerful in this book, a brilliantly edited collection of fiction. Essential reading for anyone interested in history, literature, or the human condition.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Much of the fiction written during and after World War I centered on that carnage and its cost, physically, morally, politically. But for the most part, the voices have been English, or its American variant, with occasional French and German accents. <em>No Man's Land</em> is a valuable corrective.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find war celebrities like Siegfried Sassoon and Erich Maria Remarque, but also Greeks, Turks, Czechs and Indians with names like Prezihov Voranc, Emilio Lussu, Mulk Raj Anand and Josep Pla.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An endlessly fascinating collection of bits and excerpts of fiction arising from the war. Ayrton&#x2019;s <em>No Man&#x2019;s Land</em> is hard reading almost from start to finish, but by its final pages it&#x2019;s achieved the near-impossible feat of making the First World War&#x2019;s horrors feel freshly, agonizingly new.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Open Letters Monthly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Harrowing but brilliant accounts of the human cost of war. In all its calculated costs of cruelty, its human impact, its formidable weapons of death and destruction and - yes - its futility, is captured brilliantly in this remarkable, wide-ranging anthology.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Herald</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The real strength of <em>No Man&#x2019;s Land</em> is the sheer diversity of the voices it offers, especially those from fronts often overlooked or considered peripheral in the United States and Britain. Both beautiful and ghastly.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Handsomely produced and aptly titled. The impressive number of other nationalities and other fronts it represents is unusual. Pete Ayrton's volume will undoubtedly send people in search of the books from which he has drawn such enticing extracts. Marvelous.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Times Literary Supplement</em></strong></p><h2>Caring Enough to Confront</h2><p>Discussing trust, anger, change, prejudice, blame, guilt, loyalty and conscience, the author describes a life-style for Christians who care enough to risk confronting others when differences become important. Especially for Christians who care deeply about relationships--adults, youth, pastors, couples.</p><p>Many people try to avoid conflict, but confrontation can be a catalyst for deeper loving care as we learn to integrate our needs and wants with those of others. Dr. David Augsburger believes that deepened relationships bloom out of conflict when we remember that the important issue is not what the conflict is about, but instead how the conflict is handled. Caring Enough to Confront will teach you how to build trust, cope with blame and prejudice, and be honest about anger and frustration. You&#x2019;ll learn how to confront with compassion in family, church and work relationships to resolve conflict in a healthy and healing way. Make the most of every conflict by mastering the tools of making peace.<br><b>DAVID AUGSBERGER </b>is the author of 20 books on pastoral counseling, marriage, conflict and human relations.

Their pain may still run deep, but the counsel of God runs deeper yet.</p><p>Lloyd John Ogilvie</p><h2>Supportive Therapy: A Psychodynamic Approach</h2><p>In recent years therapists have been treating more and more seriously disturbed patients, who do not respond well to insight-oriented exploratory techniques or to common-sense approaches. A therapy specifically designed for this growing population is needed and this superb new book admirably fills the gap. It is the first to provide a carefully designed clinical approach to supportive psychotherapy that is rigorously connected to psychodynamic theory.The main goal of the therapy described here is to improve ego functions and adaptations rather than to explore unconscious conflicts. Thus, the emphasis is on strengthening reality testing, discouraging impulsivity, and clarifying confused thinking, while minimizing the regression and negative transference characteristic of exploratory therapy. In chapters richly illustrated with clinical material, the author details the strategies and rationales of this practice, covering such topics as transference and countertransference, resistance, working through, and the relationship between supportive therapy and psychopharmacology. Clinically sophisticated yet immensely practical, this valuable resource will enhance the skill and understanding of every therapist&#x2014;student, clinician, or teacher&#x2014;who practices supportive psychotherapy.</p><p><b>Lawrence H.

Written by Francisco N��ez Muley, one of many coerced Christian converts, this extraordinary letter lodges a clear-sighted, impassioned protest against the unreasonable and strongly assimilationist laws that required all converted Muslims in Granada to dress, speak, eat, marry, celebrate festivals, and be buried exactly as the Castilian settler population did.<br> <br> Now available in its first English translation, N��ez Muley&#x2019;s account is an invaluable example of how Spain&#x2019;s former Muslims made active use of the written word to challenge and openly resist the progressively intolerant policies of the Spanish Crown.

Walvoord) Leading evangelical educators discuss the text of Revelation and the issues that most interest twenty-first-century readers and students. Includes a verse-by-verse explanation and background analysis.</p><p><p>As the climactic book of the New Testament, Revelation takes its readers through the pangs and throes of the world's death and then ushers them into the brilliance of the new and eternal state to come. Revelation is one of the Bible's "bookends," finishing with a triumphal sweep what Genesis begins. Yet because of its pictorial language and the complexity of its message, Revelation is often overlooked by believers convinced it's too difficult to understand. </p> <p>In this theological and textual guide to the book of Revelation, leading evangelical educators combine their efforts to examine the issues that most interest and sometimes trouble twenty-first century readers. With verse-by-verse explanations and background analysis, this handbook is a tremendous aid to understanding the scope of God's inspired Revelation. </p> <p>Topics covered include a comparison of the ways the Book of Revelation has been interpreted throughout history as well as an understanding of the book's structure. Other articles probe the book's views of the persons of the Trinity, the church, humanity, angels, salvation, and judgment.</p> <p><strong>Mal Couch</strong>, general editor, is founder and president of Tyndale Theological Seminary and Biblical Institute in Fort Worth, Texas.

In uncovering this neglected chapter of show business, he describes in detail the flimflam artistry behind the shows, the promoters and the audiences, and the gradual evolution of public opinion from awe to embarrassment. Freaks were not born, Bogdan reveals; they were manufactured by the amusement world, usually with the active participation of the freaks themselves.

Carter is Proust&#x2019;s definitive biographer.&#x201d;&#x2014;Harold Bloom&nbsp;&nbsp;Named a Notable Book of 2000 by the <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p><b>William C. Carter</b>, professor emeritus of French at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, is the author of <i>Proust in Love</i> and a new, fully annotated edition of Proust&#x2019;s classic <i>Swann&#x2019;s Way.</i>A masterful life of the eccentric pioneer who mapped the modern mind in Remembrance of Things Past (more accurately translated here as In Search of Lost Time), by the noted Proust scholar (French/Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham; The Proustian Quest, not reviewed). In seeking to reveal how one of the centurys towering novelists (18711922) ``came to produce what is arguably the most brilliant, sustained prose narration in the history of literature, Carter has produced a long, loving annotation to the autobiographical In Search. He explores his subject with a scholar's care, a novelist's eye, and a generous tolerance for readers without French. His hero is invariably ill, most often with asthma, a condition he exacerbates with drugs, a nocturnal lifestyle, and an erratic diet (in his last days he consumes only ice cream and beer; his death follows his adamant refusal to accept medical treatment for pneumonia). Proust's legendary eccentricities are on full display: his cork-lined living quarters (to ensure the quiet he craves), his vampirish avoidance of daylight, his endless revisions of his texts (In Search requires ``one of the most demanding productions in the history of publishing''), and his prodigality (he recklessly spends nearly all of his enormous inheritance). Noting the fascination of Prousts lifestyle for contemporary readers, Carter labors to explain his complicated sexuality (he fights a duel with a reviewer who has suggested he is gay, but he also pursues young men, regarding waiters at the Ritz as a particular delicacy) and is determined to establish that Proust ``never attempted to deny his Jewish heritage.'' Not even Carter's considerable narrative gifts, however, can make Proust's bedridden later years, marked by a contentious, complicated correspondence with his publisher, as compelling as his early, more extroverted life. A prodigious work, rich and racy, informed by fact, animated by imagination, utterly worthy of its wondrous subject. (47 illus., not seen) -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It describes the role that emotional disturbances play in the most common diseases and ailments, from influenza, the common cold and arthritis to diabetes, heart disease and cancer. After providing an introduction to intuitive medicine and its history, method of diagnosis, and relationship to traditional medicine, Myss and Shealy detail the deeper emotional and physical reasons why illness develops in the body. Dr Shealy offers a traditional account of a particular disease or ailment, while Dr Myss sheds light on the deeper emotional and psychic causes through her corresponding energy analysis. Confirming the link between illness and emotion, &#34;The Creation of Health&#34; puts forth a ground breaking vision of holistic healing.</p><p>Who can help asking "Why?" when they develop a disease? According to theologian and "medical intuitive" Caroline Myss, Ph.D., and co-worker C. Norman Shealy, M.D., who is a physician, neurosurgeon, and expert on pain and stress management, the answer goes further than a medical explanation. <i>The Creation of Health</i> explores the emotional, physical, and spiritual patterns that form health and the stresses that can cause disease. <p> Myss identifies eight dysfunctional patterns that lead to illness. Being aware that "negative attitudes create negative responses within the physical body" allows you to make changes toward health after identifying your emotional, psychological, and spiritual stresses. The most interesting chapters discuss specific diseases in terms of lifestyle factors, stress, and psychological patterns and energy factors, with case studies. A heart attack, for example, is "an explosion of energy attempting to break down an emotional barrier ... caused by warehousing fears and anger," says Myss. The authors alternate, rather than co-write, chapters and topics, so you know whose perspective you're reading. The theoretical sections are not easy reading, but the insights you can apply to your own health make the work immensely worthwhile. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>Caroline Myss, Ph.D., is an internationally renowned pioneer in energy medicine and the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling books <i>Anatomy of the Spirit</i>, <i>Why People Don&#x2019;t Heal and How They Can</i>, and <i>Sacred Contracts</i>.

In it, leading archaeologists from around the world contribute original analyses of prehistoric data to discover how gender systems operated in the past.</p><p>Over the past twenty years, feminist thinking has profoundly influenced almost every field of the humanities and social sciences, and has impinged upon both the content and methodology of social enquiry. Moreover, human social structures in prehistory have always been a subject of great interest to feminist scholars, who have sought in them an understanding of the origins of inequality between the sexes and of the part women have played in the rise of societies and states. <p>This pathbreaking book brings gender issues to archaeology for the first time, in an explicit and theoretically informed way. In it, leading archaeologists from around the world contribute original analyses of prehistoric data to discover how gender systems operated in the past. The scope of the studies is broad: chapters range from hunter-gatherer societies, through early agricultural communities, to civilizations of the Old and the New Worlds, across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Discussion of such diverse archaeological arenas as art, the domestication of plants, shellfishing, acorn processing, stone tool production and ceramics, and the arrangement and use of space for social, residential and work activities, demonstrates how the extent and significance of woman's role in the prehistoric world has previously been devalued.</p> <p><br> <i>Engendering Archaeology</i> exposes the androcentric nature of traditional archaeological enquiry, from its assumptions and preconceptions to the presentation of evidence and knowledge. It questions the accounts of mankind's history that have been common currency, and demonstrates convincingly the centrality of the past to any considerations of gender.</p><b>Joan M.

Itzkowitz delineates the fundamental institutions of the Ottoman state, the major divisions within the society, and the basic ideas on government and social structure. Throughout, Itzkowitz emphasizes the Ottomans' own conception of their historical experience, and in so doing penetrates the surface view provided by the insights of Western observers of the Ottoman world to the core of Ottoman existence. <br></p><p><b>Norman Itzkowitz</b> is professor in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University.

How was it that a powerful group of Allied cruisers had been surprised and almost annihilated by a Japanese striking force obliged to travel hundreds of miles through waters patrolled by Allied reconnaissance aircraft? And why - given the overwhelming air strength available to the Allies due to the presence of their aircraft carriers - were the Japanese able to escape afterwards practically unscathed, leaving more than a thousand Allied seamen dead in their wake? Who was to blame - if anyone was to blame - for such a monumental disaster? In this brilliant study, written by a retired senior Ausutralian naval officer, many of the myths and misunderstandings concerning this important naval action have been exposed and corrected.

Concentrates on the arts of Italy,Byzantium,Germany,and France from the 4th century to the late Gothic period. The main emphasis is on the continuities as well as the changes in traditions of architecture, narrative arts and iconic presentations.</p><p>Published jointly by Prentice Hall and Harry N. Abrams Inc. Broad in scope, this volume discusses the arts of the church -- architecture, sculpture, manuscript illumination, and sumptuary arts -- in Italy, Byzantium, Germany, and France from the 4th to the 14th centuries -- including Early Christian, Byzantine, Pre-Romanesque Hiberno-Saxon, Carolingian, Ottonian, Romanesque, and Gothic art.<p>YA-- From the catacombs of Rome to the rise of the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe, this book documents a remarkable, but often ignored, period in art history. Snyder's account is a fascinating, comprehensive text on that period. The preface explains the time frame of the book and Snyder's use of the church as ``theatre of the arts'' because it was ``the one unifying factor in European culture'' during those times. Using the church as focus, he demonstrates how changes in painting, sculpture, and ecclesiastical architecture reflect man's progress in pre-Renaissance Europe. The beauties of illuminated manuscript, Romanesque sculptural decoration, and Gothic stained glass are carefully described in context. Excellent comparative diagrams of architectural floor plans and copious photographs and maps provide good visual documentation. There is a wealth of reference material here for students of history and art history. --Jenni Elliott, Episcopal High School, Bellaire, Tex.</p><p>Copyright 1989 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Walden, or Life in the Woods, and On the Duty of Civil Disobedience</h2><p>Walden (also known as Life in the Woods) by Henry David Thoreau is one of the best-known non-fiction books written by an American. Published in 1854, it details Thoreau's life for two years and two months in second-growth forest around the shores of Walden Pond, not far from his friends and family in Concord, Massachusetts. Walden was written so that the stay appears to be a year, with expressed seasonal divisions. Thoreau called it an experiment in simple living. Henry David Thoreau (July 12, 1817 &#x2013; May 6, 1862; born David Henry Thoreau) was an American author, naturalist, transcendentalist, tax resister, development critic, and philosopher who is best known for Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price.

This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind. Elegant, witty, and quietly searching, Walden remains the most persuasive American argument for simplicity of life clarity of conscience.<br><br>For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by major American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books.

Its focus is on understanding the ways in which social life is variously embedded in place, space and landscape. In the fulfillment of this objective, historical imagination, textual exegesis, philosophical scrutiny, sociological interpretation, and geographical sensitivity are interwoven in such a way as to move spatial discourse to new levels of sophistication and subtlety. <p>In mapping human geography into contemporary social theory, the author addresses, reinterprets and questions key theoretical debates and issues - postcolonialism, structuration theory, feminism, deconstruction, postmodernism and poststructuralism - and explores the crucial connection between space, power and knowledge.</p> <p>Deftly argued and illustrated throughout with pointed examples, <i>Geographical Imaginations</i> is both a lucid critique of contemporary social theory and a fundamental contribution to the understanding of social life and its intrinsic spatiality.</p></p><p><b>Derek Gregory</b> was born in England in 1951.

The author concentrates on five key moments of transition: the transformation of the computer in the late 1940s from a specialized scientific instrument to a commercial product; the emergence of small systems in the late 1960s; the beginning of personal computing in the 1970s; the spread of networking after 1985; and, in a chapter written for this edition, the period 1995-2001. The new material focuses on the Microsoft antitrust suit, the rise and fall of the dot-coms, and the advent of open source software, particularly Linux. Within the chronological narrative, the book traces several overlapping threads: the evolution of the computer's internal design; the effect of economic trends and the Cold War; the long-term role of IBM as a player and as a target for upstart entrepreneurs; the growth of software from a hidden element to a major character in the story of computing; and the recurring issue of the place of information and computing in a democratic society. The focus is on the United States (though Europe and Japan enter the story at crucial points), on computing per se rather than on applications such as artificial intelligence, and on systems that were sold commercially and installed in quantities.</p></p><p>This book delivers exactly what its title promises: a straightforward and comprehensive account of the electronic digital computer's first five decades. Starting with the historic ENIAC of 1945, Ceruzzi moves nimbly through one epochal generation of computing technology after another: the gargantuan, vacuum-tube-filled mainframes of the early '50s; the sleeker, transistorized minicomputers of the '60s; the personal computers conjured up by hobbyists in the '70s; and the computer networks that have come to span offices and the globe in the last 10 years.<p> Ceruzzi places all of these developments in the context of the social phenomena that shaped them: the imperatives of Cold War research, the evolving needs of information-swamped businesses, and the quirks and dreams of counter-cultural computer hackers. But unlike some popular books about computing history, this one refuses to acknowledge any particular individual, group, or institution as its protagonist. The tale it tells is complex: a weave of high-level projects, lowbrow tinkerings, and sweeping socioeconomic transformations, with a crash course in the basics of computer architecture tossed in for good measure. The mix doesn't make for great drama, but it does offer something perhaps more valuable--the sober, subtle feel of real history unfolding. <i>--Julian Dibbell</i></p>Paul E.

So too is Earth's supply of parking spaces. In some cities, parking lots cover more than one-third of the metropolitan footprint. It's official: we have paved paradise and put up a parking lot. In <i>ReThinking a Lot</i>, Eran Ben-Joseph shares a different vision for parking's future. Parking lots, he writes, are ripe for transformation. After all, their design and function has not been rethought since the 1950s. With this book, Ben-Joseph pushes the parking lot into the twenty-first century. </p><p>Ben-Joseph shows that parking lots can be aesthetically pleasing, environmentally and architecturally responsible, and used for something other than car storage. He introduces us to some of the many alternative and nonparking purposes that parking lots have served -- from RV campgrounds to stages for "Shakespeare in the Parking Lot." He shows us parking lots that are lushly planted with trees and flowers and beautifully integrated with the rest of the built environment. With purposeful design, Ben-Joseph argues, parking lots could be significant public places, contributing as much to their communities as great boulevards, parks, or plazas. For all the acreage they cover, parking lots have received scant attention. It's time to change that; it's time to rethink the lot.</p></p><p><p>Eran Ben-Joseph has worked as a city planner and urban designer in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and the United States. Professor of Landscape Architecture and Planning at MIT, he is the author of <i>The Code of the City</i> (MIT Press) and coauthor of <i>Streets and the Shaping of Towns and Cities</i> and <i>RENEW Town</i>.</p><p>Parking spaces clumped in lots shape this rigorous analysis of open space. In <i>ReThinking a Lot</i>, Ben-Joseph explores this potentially powerful, sustainable terrain, anchoring much more than cars.</p> (<b>John Stilgoe</b>, Harvard University)<br><br><p>In <i>ReThinking a Lot</i>, Eran Ben-Joseph convincingly urges the need to bring sound design to a ubiquitous, usually negative, environmental feature: the surface parking lot. Ben-Joseph understands design too well to offer a formula for improvement over a vast diversity of conditions. What he does offer is the courage to address a neglected opportunity for design excellence and to provide discussion and examples that facilitate such design.</p> (<b>Stanford Anderson</b>, Professor, Department of Architecture, MIT)<br><br><p>Parking -- perhaps the most disruptive and nonproductive component of our contemporary landscapes -- is in this book finally represented in all its manifestations both analytically and poetically, with a challenge to designers to 'rethink' the integration of cars and the critical space they occupy in urban systems.</p> (<b>Rahul Mehrotra</b>, Professor and Chair, Department of Urban Planning and Design, Graduate School of Design, Harvard University)<br><br><p>As residual and mundane spaces of everyday life, parking lots have not captured the attention of urban designers until now. Eran Ben-Joseph sets out to correct this significant oversight. Very well illustrated, concise, and clear, this book provides a rich cultural history of these overlooked urban settings. It also effectively shows that with creative design and policy, cities can indeed turn their ugly lots into 'modest paradises.'</p> (<b>Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris</b>, Professor, UCLA Department of Urban Planning)<br><br><p>The book is sturdy and handsome with useful notes and bibliography.</p> (<i><i>Choice</i></i>)<br><br><p>...[T]he depth of research into the topic and the presentation of it in a lot of context and history make it a truly useful addition to your library.</p> (<i><i>Urban Tick</i></i>)</p><h2>The Spitting Image: Myth, Memory, and the Legacy of Vietnam</h2><p><p>One of the most resilient images of the Vietnam era is that of the anti-war protester &#x2014; often a woman &#x2014; spitting on the uniformed veteran just off the plane. The lingering potency of this icon was evident during the Gulf War, when war supporters invoked it to discredit their opposition.</p> <p>In this startling book, Jerry Lembcke demonstrates that not a single incident of this sort has been convincingly documented. Rather, the anti-war Left saw in veterans a natural ally, and the relationship between anti-war forces and most veterans was defined by mutual support. Indeed one soldier wrote angrily to Vice President Spiro Agnew that the only Americans who seemed concerned about the soldier's welfare were the anti-war activists.</p> <p>While the veterans were sometimes made to feel uncomfortable about their service, this sense of unease was, Lembcke argues, more often rooted in the political practices of the Right. Tracing a range of conflicts in the twentieth century, the book illustrates how regimes engaged in unpopular conflicts often vilify their domestic opponents for "stabbing the boys in the back."</p> <p>Concluding with an account of the powerful role played by Hollywood in cementing the myth of the betrayed veteran through such films as <i>Coming Home</i>, <i>Taxi Driver</i>, and <i>Rambo</i>, Jerry Lembcke's book stands as one of the most important, original, and controversial works of cultural history in recent years.</p></p><p>I am responding to comments about me and my book, "The Spitting Image".<p>I receive a lot of correspondence about the myth of spat-upon Vietnam veterans and some of it is in response to inquires from students about the spitting stories. The writer says there are photographs "of soldiers being hit with tomatoes and eggs." If anyone has those photographs I would love to see them.</p><p>Regarding my military service, I have never thought that being a Vietnam veteran is much of a credential for understanding the war or America's post-war culture. That said, I was a Chaplain's Assistant in the 41st Artillery Group in Vietnam in 1969.</p><p>I've never called anyone a liar for claiming they were spat on. I'm perfectly willing to repeat someone's story but unless it is somehow corroborated, I can't treat the story as true. On a Los Angeles KABC radio call-in show a couple years ago I told a caller I did not believe his story that uniforms were piled high in an LAX men's room, discarded by veterans who had deplaned there and were fearful that they would be attacked by protesters. I also politely excused myself from a recent conversation with a man saying he returned on a stretcher and "was covered in spit" in the time he was taken from the plane to an ambulance.

Through events set in motion by a misunderstanding, Chacho becomes a folk hero to his people and a dangerous fugitive to a group of zealous lawmen. Manhunters, the tale of Chacho&#39;s legendary flight, was inspired by the story of controversial Mexican fugitive Gregorio Cortez. In 1901 Cortez, a young horseman, shot a sheriff during an argument, leading to the largest concerted manhunt in Texas history.<p>It began with a misunderstanding that exploded into a killing. In no time at all, Chacho went from being a respected horse handler -- to being a hunted fugitive. And there was no doubt that the law was coming for him, because the man he shot was a gringo. The Texas Rangers sent one of their finest to find the Mexican boy -- and he did. But the story doesn't end with Chacho's capture -- it begins there.</p><p>The story of Chacho, a young, courageous Mexican, and an honest lawman's pursuit of justice, is one of the greatest tales of Texas courage every told.</p></p><h2>Septimius Severus: The African Emperor (Roman Imperial Biographies)</h2><p>In this, the only biography of Septimius Severus in English, Anthony R.

Already a well-established literary force by the age of thirty-four, Oates had written three books that had been named finalists for the National Book Award (in 1968, 1969, and 1972), and her novel <em>them</em> won the award in 1970; she had also received a number of O. Henry Awards, in addition to many other honors. Despite the warm critical reception from the literary world, however, the young author was naturally reticent about her personal life and would remain so throughout her career. </p><p><em>The Journal of Joyce Carol Oates</em>, edited by Greg Johnson, offers a rare first glimpse into the private thoughts of this extraordinary writer. This volume focuses on excerpts from the journal written during the crucial first decade, 1973-1982, one of the most productive of Oates's long career. Housed in her archive at Syracuse University, the journals themselves run to more than 5,000 single-spaced typewritten pages. Far more than just a daily account of a writer's writing life, these intimate, unrevised pages candidly explore Oates's friendship with other writers, including John Updike, Donald Barthelme, Susan Sontag, Gail Godwin, and Philip Roth, among others. Oates also describes, in vivid and captivating detail, her university teaching, her love of the natural world, her rural background, her vast reading, her critics, her travels, and, predominantly, the "silent, secret" life of the imagination.</p><p>What emerges is a fascinating portrait of the artist as a young woman, fully engaged with her world and her culture&#x2014;a writer who paradoxically thought of herself as "invisible" while becoming one of the most respected, honored, discussed, and controversial figures in American letters.</p></p><p><p>Joyce Carol Oates is a recipient of the National Medal of Humanities, the National Book Critics Circle Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award, the National Book Award, and the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in Short Fiction, and has been several times nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. She has written some of the most enduring fiction of our time, including the national bestsellers <em>We Were the Mulvaneys</em>,<em> Blonde</em>, which was nominated for the National Book Award, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Falls</em>, which won the 2005 Prix Femina. Her most recent novel is <em>A Book of American Martyrs</em>. She is the Roger S. Berlind Distinguished Professor of the Humanities at Princeton University and has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters since 1978.</p><p></p><i>Starred Review.</i> Writing is... a drug, sweet, irresistible, and exhausting, writes Oates in this fascinating and significant record of an artist's life. She was 34 when she began this experiment in consciousness, which follows the gestation and writing of many of her most important works. Oates, readers come to realize, is intensely disciplined, exquisitely sensitive, unflaggingly&#x2014;almost morbidly&#x2014;introspective, concerned with philosophical issues, attuned to mysticism and acutely responsive to the natural world. Although she abhors being described as prolific, she writes daily, with feverish energy; she herself uses the word obsessed. If a day or two passes when she isn't writing, she feels profound worthlessness. Teaching, she reveals, is a vital component of her well-being, although it often leaves her exhausted. The journal records her relationships with contemporary authors, including Philip Roth, Susan Sontag, John Updike, Gail Godwin, Stanley Elkin, John Gardner and Donald Barthelme. She is candid about her intensely intimate marriage to Raymond Smith, her lack of maternal instinct and the hours she spends at the piano, an obsession almost equal to her writing. Overall, this journal immerses the reader in a complex, searching, imaginative personality&#x2014;an artist who continues to refine her search for literary expression. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos. <i>(Oct. 2)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Stesichorus was called by ancient writers "most Homeric"&#x2014;a recognition of his epic themes and noble style. He composed verses about the Trojan War and its aftermath, the Argonauts, the adventures of Heracles. He may have been a solo singer, performing these poems to his own cithara accompaniment. Ibycus probably belonged to the colony of Rhegium in southwestern Italy. Like Stesichorus he wrote lyrical narratives on mythological themes, but he also composed erotic poems. Simonides is said to have spent his later years in Sicily. He was in Athens at the time of the Persian Wars, though, and was acclaimed for his epitaph on the Athenians who died at Marathon. He was a successful poet in various genres, including victory odes, dirges, and dithyrambic poetry. The power of his pathos emerges in the fragments we have.</p><p>All the extant verse of these poets is given in this third volume of David Campbell's edition of Greek lyric poetry, along with the ancients' accounts of their lives and works. Ten contemporary poets are also included, among them Arion, Lasus, and Pratinas.</p><p>The Greek Lyric edition is five volumes. Sappho and Alcaeus&#x2014; the illustrious singers of sixth-century Lesbos&#x2014;are in the first volume. Volume II contains the work of Anacreon, composer of solo song; the <i>Anacreontea;</i> and the earliest writers of choral poetry, notably the seventh-century Spartans Alcman and Terpander. Bacchylides and other fifth-century poets are in Volume IV along with Corinna (although some argue that she belongs to the third century). The last volume includes the new school of dithyrambic poets (mid-fifth to mid-fourth century), together with the anonymous poems: drinking songs, children's songs, cult hymns, and others.</p></p><p><p>David A.

The lists that Dr. Watts has prepared are taken from W. R. Harper&#39;s Hebrew Vocabularies, which has been revised and corrected in comparison with Kohler-Baumgartner, Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros. Where a verb occurs in only one stem, this is noted in the Hebrew list. When a verb has different meanings in different stems, this is noted in the English list. Nouns and adjectives from the same root are listed together so that the student may learn to distinguish them immediately. Words are arranged according to the frequency of their occurrence. The author has used these lists in mimeographed form for more than five years in teaching elementary Hebrew to theological students.</p><p>John D. W.

We have left the Cenozoic, the &#x201c;new period of life,&#x201d; and are now in the midst of the Necrocene, a period of mass extinction and reversal. It is argued that an effective response to global crisis requires attention to all major spheres of social determination, including the social institutional structure, the social ideology, the social imaginary, and the social ethos. In this wide-ranging and ruthlessly compassionate critique, John P. Clark explores examples of significant progress in this direction, including the Zapatista movement in Chiapas, the Democratic Autonomy Movement in Rojava, indigenous movements in defense of the commons, the solidarity economy movement, and efforts to create liberated base communities and affinity groups within anarchism and other radical social movements. In the end, the book presents a vision of hope for social and ecological regeneration through the rebirth of a libertarian and communitarian social imaginary, and the flourishing of a free cooperative community globally.</p><p><b>John P.

Humans can still save the planet, he writes, by adopting a truly human-centered bioregional and anarchist way of life. The Paris Agreement, the Zapatista communities of Chiapas, the Rojava movement rising out of Syria&#x2019;s ashes, Zen and Sufism, situationism and the lessons of the 1968 student revolt in France, the Black Panthers&#x2014;all offer critical lessons for organizers and activists seeking Clark's &#x2018;beloved community.&#x2019; In particular for Clark, a New Orleans native, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina demonstrates problems as well as solutions. Some readers will be put off by the frequent allusions to mystical and religious ideas, but Clark&#x2019;s point is that Earth&#x2019;s desperate situation requires drawing on all possible solutions. Despite the dark warnings, Clark offers hope for a future&#x2014;though not Utopian&#x2014;world of decentralized, libertarian, and ecologically sane communities." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>T. S.

If consumers make decisions unconsciously, why do we persist in asking them directly through traditional marketing research why they do what they do? They simply can't tell us because they don't really know. Before marketers develop strategies, they need to recognize that consumers have strategies too . . . human strategies, not consumer strategies. We need to go beyond asking why, and begin to ask how, behavior change occurs. Here, author Douglas Van Praet takes the most brilliant and revolutionary concepts from cognitive science and applies them to how we market, advertise, and consume in the modern digital age. Van Praet simplifies the most complex object in the known universe&#x2015;the human brain&#x2015;into seven codified actionable steps to behavior change. These steps are illustrated using real world examples from advertising, marketing, media, and business to consciously unravel what brilliant marketers and ad practitioners have long done intuitively, deconstructing the real story behind some of the greatest marketing and business successes in recent history, such as Nike's "Just Do It" campaign; "Got Milk?"; Wendy's "Where's the Beef?"; and the infamous Volkswagen "Punch Buggy" launch as well as their beloved "The Force" (Mini Darth Vader) Super Bowl commercial.</p><p>Douglas Van Praet is executive vice president at Deutsch LA, one of the nation&#39;s hottest ad agencies, where his responsibilities include group planning director for the iconic, highly acclaimed and coveted Volkswagen account.<p>&#x201c;A provocative approach that should give pause to consumers as well as marketers.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Doug has been an instrumental strategic guide for transforming and redefining the Volkswagen brand.

This handsomely illustrated book by Douglas D.C. Chambers instead discusses the philosophy of gardening and landscaping that developed during this period, the gardeners who made the gardens, and the new planting materials available to them.<br>Between 1650 and 1750, new developments in botanical horticulture led to the availability of a vast new repertory of trees and shrubs. These imports, mainly from America, were the materials that made the extensive English landscape garden possible. Inspired by texts of Virgil, Pliny, and Horace as well as by scientific advances of the newly founded Royal Society, theorists and designers, owner-planters and countless gardeners and nurserymen used the expanded vocabulary of botanical taxonomy to create gardens that transformed the look of the English landscape. Chambers illustrates how philosophy and practice, ancient ideals and horticultural experimentation all served one end: the creation of an ideal landscape that was both Edenic and classical. Out of this came not only the foundation collection for the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew but an English landscape of forest garden, ferme ornee, and park landscape that would have been inconceivable a century earlier: the English landscape that we know today.</p><p></p><h2>The Chicago Guide to Communicating Science (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)</h2><p>Whether you are a graduate student or a senior scientist, your reputation rests on the ability to communicate your ideas and data. In this straightforward and accessible guide, Scott L. Montgomery offers detailed, practical advice on crafting every sort of scientific communication, from research papers and conference talks to review articles, interviews with the media, e-mail messages, and more. Montgomery avoids the common pitfalls of other guides by focusing not on rules and warnings but instead on how skilled writers and speakers actually learn their trade-by imitating and adapting good models of expression. Moving step-by-step through samples from a wide variety of scientific disciplines, he shows precisely how to choose and employ such models, where and how to revise different texts, how to use visuals to enhance your presentation of ideas, why writing is really a form of experimentation, and more.<br><br>He also traces the evolution of scientific expression over time, providing a context crucial for understanding the nature of technical communication today.

Gay/Lesbian Studies. New to SPD. Here is a revealing look into male effeminacy: why some gay men are swishy, why other gay men are more masculine, and why effeminate men arouse anger, disgust, and disdain in both gay and straight men.

They drew together radical new ideologies, often complex and hard to grasp, and melded them into the simpler structure of narrative. Crucially, they cast narratives that appealed to the moral instincts of ordinary, decent people. This moral vision overwhelmed the church and silenced its faltering apologists. The author argues that if Christians still believe they have have good news in the sphere of sexual ethics, then two big tasks lie ahead. Our first priority is to work out what has gone so badly wrong, both in our understanding and application of what the Bible teaches and the way we have presented our case to the non-churched. And then we must offer a better story, one that fires the imagination with such force that people will say, &#39;I want that to be true.&#39; This book offers a confident, biblically rooted moral vision which needs to be shared with prayer and courage.</p><p></p><h2>The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle: The Original 1922 Edition with Actual Illustrations by the Author</h2><p><p>The award-winning "The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle" by Hugh Lofting is one of his best known works, entertaining young readers for almost a century.&nbsp; The idea of being able to speak to animals is one that mesmerizes kids even today.&nbsp; This edition contains the original illustrations that Lofting drew himself.&nbsp; While some editions have been 'updated' to reflect modern sensibilities, this one contains the exact text as originally published in 1922.&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>Medieval Knights (Cambridge Introduction to World History)</h2><p>In this book, Trevor Cairns traces the evolution of the knight in Europe: from barbarian warrior to horseman-archer, through to the courtly knight as soldier and &#39;gentleman&#39;.

Author Eric Darnell Pritchard provides a theoretical framework for studying the literacy work of Black LGBTQ people, who do not fit into the traditional categories imposed on their language practices and identities. Examining the myriad ways literacy is used to inflict harm, Pritchard discusses how these harmful events prompt Black LGBTQ people to ensure their own survival by repurposing literacy through literacy performances fueled by accountability to self and communal love towards social and political change, a process the author calls &#x201c;restorative literacies.&#x201d; Pritchard highlights restorative literacies in literacy institutions (e.g., libraries, schools), historical records repositories, religious and spiritual spaces, parties, community events, activist organizations, and digital spheres. This trailblazing study draws connections between race and queerness in literacy, composition, and rhetoric and provides the basis for a sustainable dialogue on their intersections in the discipline.</p><p><b>Eric Darnell Pritchard </b>is an assistant professor of English at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. His article &#x201c;For Colored Kids Who Committed Suicide, Our Outrage Isn&#x2019;t Enough: Queer Youth of Color, Bullying, and the Discursive Limits of Identity and Safety&#x201d; in <i>Harvard Educational Review </i>won the 2014 CCCC Lavender Rhetorics Award for Excellence in Queer Scholarship."To say that this work is timely would be an understatement; the examination of Queers of Color literacies is long overdue and particularly poignant in the current political climate. Fashioning Lives does not fill the gap as much as exposes the gap in literacy, rhetoric, and composition studies as well as lay out a framework with which other scholars may investigate Queers of Color Literacies beyond those found within LGBT communities. Additionally, he captures narratives of Black LGBTQ people whose narratives may be otherwise lost to continued erasure of Black and Queer individuals. Fashioning Lives is a wake-up call to scholars of literacy, rhetoric, and composition, particularly those involved in community engagement and public rhetoric, asking that we take notice of the literacies that have been taken for granted, specifically those in which race, gender, and sexuality intersect. Readers are challenged to see the ways Black LGBTQ people interact with literacy despite the numerous ways in which it is continually being denied them even today. " <b>&#x2014; Megan M. Opperman, <i>Reflections</i></b><br> "Through inquiry into Black queer literacy practices, Eric Darnell Pritchard thoughtfully and compellingly queers more monolithic understandings of literacy, challenging the fields of literacy, composition, and rhetoric for their inattention to Black queer literacy while arguing for the ways in which these literacy practices might expand understandings of literacy itself."<b>&#x2014;</b><b>Adam Hubrig, <i>Present Tense: A Journal of Rhetoric in Society</i></b><br> &#x201c;<i>Fashioning Lives</i> brings to visibility and critical attention thought-provoking literacy histories of African Americans who identify as LGBTQ and underscores literacy as a tool for surveillance and censorship but also for salvation and restoration. Pritchard&#x2019;s work challenges us to recognize and understand the nature, ways, and means of &#x2018;restorative literacies&#x2019; in the work that we do.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Jacqueline Jones Royster</b>, coauthor, <i>Feminist Rhetorical Practices: New Horizons for Rhetoric, Composition, and Literacy Studies</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pritchard shows that the stakes of literacy touch on the matter of how we read alongside and against discourses of race, gender, class, and sexuality.

Rather than merely contributing another case to the current body of literacy scholarship, Eric Darnell Pritchard&#x2019;s work stretches the conceptual and theoretical boundaries of the field itself. Full of beautiful writing and original insights, this text is a welcome contribution to Black studies, Queer studies, and literacy, composition, and rhetorical studies.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Marc Lamont Hill</b>, distinguished professor of Africana studies at Morehouse College, correspondent for BET News, host of <i>VH1 Live, </i>and author of&nbsp;<i>Nobody: Casualties of America's War on the Vulnerable, from Ferguson to Flint and Beyond</i><br><br> "The prologue introduces the reader to the book&#x2019;s style of using stories as theory and elevating the personal to the political and scholarly realm. This is achieved when Pritchard traces his own literacy development from a young age to a graduate student examining Black Queer art in a university museum. His stories are presented to the reader as a way to ground others&#x2019; stories while also laying bare Pritchard&#x2019;s own subject position. These moves are not surprising considering Pritchard&#x2019;s use of feminist theory throughout the book, but it is still refreshing to have an author so vividly position himself. This is an act of love that links Pritchard to his research participants and his readers; he is not taking others&#x2019; stories without giving his own story in return."--<b>Galvin P.

Through their enduring mythology, the Mayas of Yucatan, the Aztecs of Mexico, and the Incas of Peru have left us tantalizing images of their now-disappeared societies, once among the most advanced on earth. Illustrated with more than 100 photographs of important artifacts and archeological sites, this rich and fascinating collection reveals their visions of the creation of the world (and its destruction and recreation); the forces of nature; life, death and destiny; and animal spirits. 21 legends in all, each touched with magic and mystical power, include the Aztec tale "The Feathered Serpent"; the Mayan myth of "The Rain Goddess and the Egg Child"; the Incan story "How Manco-Capac Made the First People. Bonus: a list of Gods and Goddesses.<br></p><p>Like Penman, Diana Ferguson (The Myths Retold) has long been interested in folklore and the oral storytelling tradition. Fascinated by the history and cultures of three highly developed ancient societies--the Mayans, followed by the Aztecs in Mesoamerica and the Incas farther south--Ferguson examines their artifacts and those of the Spanish conquistadors, in relation to the traditions preserved today by their many descendants in Yucatan, Mexico and Peru who still speak the native languages.

It is the first such work by a post-Soviet Russian scholar to appear in English. Drawing on the latest Russian and Western historical scholarship, Alexander Polunov examines the decay of the two central institutions of tsarist Russia: serfdom and autocracy. Polunov explains how the major social groups - the gentry, merchants, petty townspeople, peasants, and ethnic minorities - reacted to the Great Reforms, and why, despite the emergence of a civil society and capitalist institutions, a reformist, evolutionary path did not become an alternative to the Revolution of 1917. He provides detailed portraits of many tsarist bureaucrats and political reformers, complete with quotations from their writings, to explain how the principle of autocracy, although significantly weakened by the Great Reforms in mid-century, reasserted itself under the last two emperors. Polunov stresses the relevance, for Russians in the post-Soviet period, of issues that remained unresolved in the pre-Revolutionary period, such as the question of private property in land and the relationship between state regulation and private initiative in the economy.</p><p>&#34;Ideally suited for surveys as well as specialized courses on Russia&#39;s long nineteenth century, Polunov&#39;s new text deftly synthesizes decades of Russian and Western scholarship. It is the comprehensive yet concise and clearly written narrative that those who teach this period have been looking for. I intend to make the book required reading for my students.&#34; - Donald J. Raleigh, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill &#34;Polunov&#39;s interpretation of the last century of imperial rule marks a sharp break with Soviet-era histories of the late Russian Empire. Rather than view the events from the Napoleonic Wars to World War I as the prehistory of... 1917, he examines the decay of the two major institutions of the empire - serfdom and autocracy - from an essentially liberal and democratic standpoint.... His account helps to explain why the tsarist government successfully resisted fundamental change at crucial moments in the nineteenth century and why a reformist, evolutionary path did not become an alternative to the Bolshevik Revolution. The moral and political dramas described by Polunov have lost none of their relevance. The struggle between militarism and authoritarian rule on the one hand and humanitarianism and the rule of law on the other persists in the post-Soviet era as well.&#34; - From the foreword by Thomas C.

If only it had been a dream.'<br><br>In 'The Doll', a waterlogged notebook is washed ashore. Its pages tell a dark story of obsession and jealousy. But the fate of its narrator is a mystery.<br><br>Most of the stories in this haunting collection were written early in Daphne du Maurier's career - when she was still in her early twenties - yet they display her mastery of atmosphere, tension and intrigue and reveal a cynicism far beyond her years.</p><p><p>The lost stories of Daphne du Maurier, collected in one volume for the first time.</p><p>Before she wrote <em>Rebecca</em>, the novel that would cement her reputation as a twentieth-century literary giant, a young Daphne du Maurier penned short fiction in which she explored the images, themes, and concerns that informed her later work. Originally published in periodicals during the early 1930s, many of these stories never found their way into print again . . . until now.</p><p>Tales of human frailty and obsession, and of romance gone tragically awry, the thirteen stories in <em>The Doll</em> showcase an exciting budding talent before she went on to write one of the most beloved novels of all time. In these pages, a waterlogged notebook washes ashore revealing a dark story of jealousy and obsession, a vicar coaches a young couple divided by class issues, and an older man falls perilously in love with a much younger woman&#x2014;with each tale demonstrating du Maurier&#x2019;s extraordinary storytelling gifts and her deep understanding of human nature.</p>Daphne du Maurier (1907-89) was born in London, the daughter of the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and granddaughter of George du Maurier, the author and artist. In 1931 her first novel,<i>The Loving Spirit</i>, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel<i>Rebecca</i>that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children.<br>Many of du Maurier's bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock's<i>The Birds</i>and Nicolas Roeg's<i>Don't Look Now</i>. In 1969 du Maurier was awarded a DBE.

This book tells the story of six Central American and Mexican children who are driven from their homes by violence and deprivation, and who embark alone, risking their lives, on the perilous journey north. They suffer coercive arrests at the U.S. border, then land in detention, only to be caught up in the battle to obtain legal status. <i>Whose Child Am I?</i> looks inside a vast, labyrinthine system by documenting in detail the experiences of these youths, beginning with their arrest by immigration authorities, their subsequent placement in federal detention, followed by their appearance in deportation proceedings and release from custody, and, finally, ending with their struggle to build new lives in the United States. This book shows how the U.S. government got into the business of detaining children and what we can learn from this troubled history.</p><p>"How did the US government get into the business of detaining thousands of unaccompanied children every year? How did this become the dominant paradigm for dealing with very young and vulnerable migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America?&nbsp; These questions are urgent and topical as the US confronts massive inflows of unaccompanied child migrants along its southern border.

A country of absorption became a country of exodus, and Zionism became a central focus of Argentine Jewry, interlocking families and fates separated by oceans and continents. <p>�&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Haim Anvi</b> is Professor of Modern Jewish History at the Institute of Contemporary Jewry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Hebrew</p><h2>Healthy Sexuality</h2><p><p>The underlying premise of this book, and what makes it unique, is that human sexuality is intimately tied to our overall health and wellness. Our sexuality impacts our physical, intellectual, emotional, social, spiritual, and environmental/occupational health and well being in a myriad of ways. It is a key component of our personality, identity and mental health. It also give us a unique sense of interconnectedness with other humans, and the cycle of life. Our sexuality is also impacted by our overall level of health and well being across the six dimensions. High-level health and wellness contribute to improved sexual functioning and satisfaction. Every chapter of the book points out the interplay between the healthy expression of our sexuality and our overall level of health and wellness.</p><p>Many features such as Marginal Definitions, Thought Questions, Personal Exploration Activities, and Sex in Society boxes are woven into the book to illustrate this connection between our sexuality and our health. Some key features that specifically reinforce the health-sexuality connection are:</p><ul><li>Case Studies throughout each chapter cover a diverse cross section of people and health issues and illustrate how the material in the chapter connects to real individuals in everyday situations.</li><li>Healthy Sex Hints within each chapter are practical, step-by-step suggestions for achieving optimal sexual health and well-being related to issues brought up in the chapter.</li><li>Wellness Syntheses are located throughout each chapter and tie the chapter content to the six dimensions of health and wellness&#x2015;physical, intellectual, emotional, social, spiritual, and environmental/ occupational in a meaningful way.</li></ul><p>All of the book&#x2019;s features combine to produce a thoroughly-researched and referenced textbook that is also very reader-friendly and hands-on. Students have multiple opportunities to apply the content to their own lives and personal sexuality.

Gyan Prakash, one of the most influential historians of India writing today, explores in fresh and unexpected ways the complexities, contradictions, and profound importance of this relationship in the history of the subcontinent. He reveals how science served simultaneously as an instrument of empire and as a symbol of liberty, progress, and universal reason--and how, in playing these dramatically different roles, it was crucial to the emergence of the modern nation.</p><br><p> Prakash ranges over two hundred years of Indian history, from the early days of British rule to the dawn of the postcolonial era. He begins by taking us into colonial museums and exhibitions, where Indian arts, crafts, plants, animals, and even people were categorized, labeled, and displayed in the name of science. He shows how science gave the British the means to build railways, canals, and bridges, to transform agriculture and the treatment of disease, to reconstruct India's economy, and to transfigure India's intellectual life--all to create a stable, rationalized, and profitable colony under British domination.</p><br><p> But Prakash points out that science also represented freedom of thought and that for the British to use it to practice despotism was a deeply contradictory enterprise. Seizing on this contradiction, many of the colonized elite began to seek parallels and precedents for scientific thought in India's own intellectual history, creating a hybrid form of knowledge that combined western ideas with local cultural and religious understanding. Their work disrupted accepted notions of colonizer versus colonized, civilized versus savage, modern versus traditional, and created a form of modernity that was at once western and indigenous.</p><br><p> Throughout, Prakash draws on major and minor figures on both sides of the colonial divide, including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, the nationalist historian and novelist Romesh Chunder Dutt, Prafulla Chandra Ray (author of <i>A History of Hindu Chemistry</i>), Rudyard Kipling, Lord Dalhousie, and John Stuart Mill. With its deft combination of rich historical detail and vigorous new arguments and interpretations, <i>Another Reason</i> will recast how we understand the contradictory and colonial genealogy of the modern nation.</p></p><p><p>"In this tour de force of historical scholarship and archival invention, Gyan Prakash focuses on the political culture of scientific thought as the crucible of emergent Indian nationalism. He produces a brilliant genealogy of 'colonial modernity,' agile and attentive to contemporary postcolonial questions: the contradictory desires for both science and tradition, 'newness' and orthodoxy, the secular and the sacred. Immersed in such complexities, Prakash retrieves the aspirational, progressive voices of the freedom movement to address contemporary Indian life. This is a superb work of historical revision by a writer of great insight and imagination."<b>--Homi Bhabha, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"This is a pathbreaking work. It adds a new dimension to the study of colonialism by holding up the mirror of science to the Raj and reciprocally that of governmentality to science in a colonial condition. Caught up in this double reflection, the problem of modernity appears in a fresh but disturbing light. A truly brilliant achievement."<b>--Ranajit Guha</b></p><p>"Gyan Prakash mounts a powerful and sustained argument in this book for treating the dissemination of science in colonial India not, as conventional historiography would have it, as the gradual supersession of backwardness and superstition and the spread of universal enlightenment, but as a case of hybrid growth. As is to be expected from Prakash, the research is meticulous and solid and his presentation is clear and forceful."<b>--Partha Chatterjee, author of <i>The Nation and Its Fragments</i></b></p><b>Gyan Prakash</b> is Professor of History at Princeton University.

This updated and expanded second edition includes new personal stories, new data on meaning, a new chapter on the difference meaning makes in people&#x2019;s lives, and new exercises to help apply the seven principles.</p></p><p><p>Alex Pattakos, PhD, is cofounder of the Global Meaning Institute with offices in the United States, Canada, and Greece. His unique background includes being a mental health administrator, professor of public and business administration, consultant with the White House, and advisor to the commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration. He is also the coauthor with Elaine Dundon of The OPA! Way: Finding Joy &amp; Meaning in Everyday Life &amp; Work. As a leader of the Meaning Movement, he is focused on helping others find meaning in life, work, and society.</p> <p>Elaine Dundon, MBA, is the cofounder of the Global Meaning Institute.

A thought leader in the field of personal and organizational innovation, she authored the best-selling book The Seeds of Innovation and created the groundbreaking course on innovation management at the University of Toronto. Her work evolved to the &#x201c;human side of innovation,&#x201d; incorporating meaning, leadership, philosophy, and metaphysics to help people and organizations reach their full potential.</p>The late Viktor Frankl's hopeful <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> emerged from his experience in a Nazi concentration camp. With Frankl's blessing, Pattakos, a cofounder of the Innovation Group consultancy and a former professor of public and business administration, applies Frankl's lessons to corporate America's workplaces. Logotherapy, Frankl's therapeutic approach, says we are free to respond to all aspects of our destiny; Pattakos argues that if we all have a will to meaning, then even if we work for unenlightened companies, we can still "connect meaningfully with others" within the workplace. Finding your sense of humor, giving to others and forgiving, and "de-reflecting" (or shifting your focus of attention) are all strategies for connection; one should consider "ten positive things" when losing a job or taking a pay cut. Pattakos ends each chapter with a "Meaning Moment" and a "Meaning Question," which can seem contrived (how exactly is <i>your</i> work like a "mission"?) and a lot of the advice will feel like familiar workplace etiquette that has been rebranded. Still, Pattakos's is a humane approach that allows for purpose in even the most purposeless-seeming environments, which is surely palliative care&#x2014;if not a cure&#x2014;for work ruts.

Juxtaposing the concepts of diaspora and citizenship, this book offers an innovative framework to help us understand how diasporic subjects engage the politics of cultural and political belonging in a transnational context. It does so by examining the interaction between continually shifting geopolitical dynamics, as well as the maneuvers undertaken by diasporic people to negotiate and transform those conditions. In essence, this book explores the contingent citizenship experienced by diasporic Chinese and their efforts to imagine and construct "home" in diaspora.</p><p>&#x201c;Memories of a Future Home is a masterful ethnography, focusing specifically on the different groups of Chinese in Panama and their ongoing negotiations regarding identity, nationality, and home.

What if for one day Jesus lives your life with his heart?</i><p> Within these opening lines lies the premise of Max Lucado's book about the possibility of becoming "just like Jesus." In recounting the biblical stories of Jesus' life and deeds, Lucado then explains how Jesus' acts of compassion, forgiveness, honesty, and faith can be reflected in anyone's everyday life. Lucado's concrete analogy of "just like Jesus" helps many readers grasp the fundamentals of Christianity in a new and inspiring way. Furthermore, in taking on the values, heart and deeds of Jesus, Lucado believes, Christians can expect a richer, more accessible relationship with God. "Jesus had unbroken communion with his father," writes Lucado. "Do you suppose the Father desires the same for us? Absolutely ... God has the same abiding intimacy with you that he had with his son."</p><p> One of the reasons that Lucado's popularity has soared is that he combines straightforward storytelling skills with simple, unfettered theology to explain how Christianity influences modern life, from marriage and career to golf games and traffic jams. Fans will also appreciate his companion study guide at the end of the book, which offers provocative questions relating to the themes of each chapter. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Max Lucado</b>, minister for the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, is the husband of Denalyn and father of Jenna, Andrea, and Sara.

How were they discovered? What should we retain today from the conceptual upheavals he initiated? Through a selection of concrete scenes taken from Einstein&#39;s life, the author offers a view into the formation of his theories, as well as reminders of the day-to-day applications of his ideas. Simultaneously the reader is lead through a reflection on their philosophical impact: How should we think of time according to the theory of relativity, which removes any meaningful &#34;now&#34; and shows that twins can have different ages? How should we think of reality when quantum theory predicts that spatially separated objects nevertheless remain connected through Einstein&#39;s notion of &#34;entanglement,&#34; which has recently been verified through scientific observation?

An interesting feature of the book is that, after the period during which Einstein is shown contributing actively to physical theory, the next generation of physicists find inspiration for particular aspects of their own work in the influence of specific remarks or attributes of Einstein. Outside the technical exposition, Damour pursues many of the connections fo Einstein's thought with broader society. For example, he points to the scholarship on Proust revealing the influence of relativity on <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>. Damour's book is a serious effort on the centenary of Einstein's <em>annus mirabilis</em> to examine his intellectual accomplishment, its sources and its influence.

Faraday made the discoveries upon which most of twentieth-century technology is based and readers of this book will enjoy finding out in how many ways we are indebted to him. The story of his life speaks to us across the years and is a fascinating read, especially when the tale is told with the understanding and gusto that Professor Thomas-one of the UK's leading scientists-brings to the telling. <br><br>Faraday took great trouble to make the latest discoveries of science, his own and others', intelligible to the layman, and the tradition he fostered has been kept alive ever since, so that the Royal Institution is as well known for its contributions to education as for its research. Written in a concise, nontechnical style, Michael Faraday and the Royal Institution: The Genius of Man and Place is a human account that provides an introduction to the roots of modern science and ways in which scientists work. The book is lavishly illustrated with drawings, cartoons, photographs, and letters-many never before published. There is no similar book on Faraday that interprets his genius in modern, everyday terms, making it understandable, interesting, and exciting reading for scientists and nonscientists alike.</p><p>&#34;I wish I had the space to detail the many excellences of this work.

Or to have &#34;hyperactive&#34; added to the label (ADHD)? What can teachers do to boost the success of students with attention and behavioral difficulties? Are we relying too much on medication for these kids and not enough on new perspectives on learning, child development, the child&#39;s socioeconomic and cultural background, biological and psychological research, and the learner&#39;s emotional and social needs? Armstrong urges educators and parents to look for the positive characteristics in learners who may carry the ADD/ADHD label. Are they bursting with energy? Are they intensely creative? Do they enjoy hands-on learning? Are they natural leaders? Are they unusually introspective and reflective? We need to look beyond a &#34;deficit&#34; approach and embrace a more holistic view of learners that includes teaching to their multiple intelligences, learning styles, and other brain-friendly approaches.

Emphasis is placed upon a conceptual understanding of our every day world from the perspective of atoms and molecules. Twelve core chapters cover basic chemical concepts such as atomic models, chemical bonding, and chemical reactions. These are followed by seven chapters organized around chemistry-related topics, such as nutrition, drugs, agriculture, water resources, the atmosphere, commercial materials, and sources of energy. The end-of-chapter study material for each chapter is extensive and includes Matching Key Terms, Review Questions, Insights to Hands-On Chemistry activities, Exercises, Suggested Readings and Websites, and, for select chapters, Problems and Discussion Topics.</p><p>John Suchocki received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1987 from Virginia Commonwealth University, where his research focused on the isolation and characterization of natural products.

Principe, one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on the subject, brings alchemy out of the shadows and restores it to its important place in human history and culture. By surveying what alchemy was and how it began, developed, and overlapped with a range of ideas and pursuits, Principe illuminates the practice. He vividly depicts the place of alchemy during its heyday in early modern Europe, and then explores how alchemy has fit into wider views of the cosmos and humanity, touching on its enduring place in literature, fine art, theater, and religion as well as its recent acceptance as a serious subject of study for historians of science. In addition, he introduces the reader to some of the most fascinating alchemists, such as Zosimos and Basil Valentine, whose lives dot alchemy&#x2019;s long reign from the third century and to the present day. Through his exploration of alchemists and their times, Principe pieces together closely guarded clues from obscure and fragmented texts to reveal alchemy&#x2019;s secrets, and&#x2014;most exciting for budding alchemists&#x2014;uses them to recreate many of the most famous recipes in his lab, including those for the &#x201c;glass of antimony&#x201d; and &#x201c;philosophers&#x2019; tree.&#x201d; This unique approach brings the reader closer to the actual work of alchemy than any other book.<br><br></p><p><b>Lawrence M. Principe</b> is the Drew Professor of the Humanities in the Department of the History of Science and Technology and the Department of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University.

Lawrence Principe&#x2019;s delightful writing style brings to life a depth of learning matched by few in the field. This expertise, coupled with the author&#x2019;s determination to strip his topic of anachronism, sets <i>The Secrets of Alchemy</i> apart from the usual introductory tome. After comments on alchemy&#x2019;s lingering popular appeal (think Harry Potter and <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>), Principe engages with the misconceptions that have long dogged his subject, particularly its association with magic, mysticism and quackery. A key premise of the book is that these are often modern associations. To understand how alchemy &#x2018;worked&#x2019; for its practitioners, we must meet them on their own terms.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>"This ele�gant, readable book, packed with information and reve�lation, covers the history of alchemy from its shadowy origins in Hellenistic Egypt to its scholarly recovery in the 20th century.

Again and again, Principe melds rich his�torical erudition with deft chemical manip�ulation.

But at last this gap is filled, and by one of the experts best qualified to do so. Lawrence M. Principe&#x2019;s survey is not just reliable and engaging but an essential corrective to the many depictions that romanticize, misdirect, or muddy our view of what alchemy was about. Principe&#x2019;s erudite demystification will enable alchemy to take its proper place as an important stage in the evolution of technology, science, and our understanding of the world.&#x201d;<br><br> (Philip Ball, author of Shapes: Natures Patterns: A Tapestry in Three Parts)<br><br>&#x201c;Lawrence Principe has produced a work that is eminently readable and that sacrifices none of its critical edge or erudition.&nbsp; . . . It&#x2019;s precisely the fact that alchemy is such an elusive target, and such a m�lange of the practical and the ridiculous, the physical and the metaphysical, that makes Principe&#x2019;s book so engaging. <i>The Secrets of Alchemy </i>is one of those rare books that, in the best possible sense, asks many more questions than it can answer, with each answered question suggesting a host of other lines of thought.&#x201d;<br><br> (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;The book&#x2019;s greatest accomplishment is its depiction of the values and assumptions that formed the alchemical worldview, and how they preceded, coexisted with, and led to a structured scientific methodology. In the sections most entertaining for general readers, Principe recreates various alchemical recipes. As a clear elucidation of a fascinating but, by its nature, obscure topic, this book will appeal to those interested in the history of science.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Making sense out of alchemy is nearly as consuming and difficult a project as making gold with it. &nbsp;Lawrence M.

But as the former Editor-in-Chief of <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em> reveals in this shocking expose, these innocuous-seeming gifts are just the tip of an iceberg that is distorting the practice of medicine and jeopardizing the health of millions of Americans today. <br> In <em>On the Take</em>, Dr. Jerome Kassirer offers an unsettling look at the pervasive payoffs that physicians take from big drug companies and other medical suppliers, arguing that the billion-dollar onslaught of industry money has deflected many physicians' moral compasses and directly impacted the everyday care we receive from the doctors and institutions we trust most. Underscored by countless chilling untold stories, the book illuminates the financial connections between the wealthy companies that make drugs and the doctors who prescribe them. Kassirer details the shocking extent of these financial enticements and explains how they encourage bias, promote dangerously misleading medical information, raise the cost of medical care, and breed distrust. Among the questionable practices he describes are: the disturbing number of senior academic physicians who have financial arrangements with drug companies; the unregulated "front" organizations that advocate certain drugs; the creation of biased medical education materials by the drug companies themselves; and the use of financially conflicted physicians to write clinical practice guidelines or to testify before the FDA in support of a particular drug.<br> A brilliant diagnosis of an epidemic of greed, <em>On the Take</em> offers insight into how we can cure the medical profession and restore our trust in doctors and hospitals.</p><p><br><strong>Jerome P. Kassirer</strong> is Distinguished Professor at Tufts University School of Medicine and Adjunct Professor of Medicine at Yale University School of Medicine. Editor-in-Chief of <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> for more than 8 years, he has been honored by membership in the Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has been referred to as the "Conscience of American Medicine."

Kassirer slams his fellow physicians.... 'It shouldn't have to be patients' responsibilities to protect themselves against the medical profession,' Kassirer writes. Bravo to that."--Tom Graham, <em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"Documents with well-referenced examples, how conflicts of interest, primarily financial in nature, have infiltrated all areas of the profession."--<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em><p></p><br>"Kassirer...has taken on the daunting task of documenting the varied and ingenious ways in which his fellow physicians have managed to accept money and gifts from pharmaceutical companies without calling the practice 'bribery'.... One virtue of this fine book, at least as a muckraking exhibit, is that its author, a physician of the old school, has been around long enough to see a lot of unraked muck.... You have to admire Kassirer's willingness to call a spade a spade."--<em>American Prospect</em><p></p><br>"An important and thought-provoking analysis of the extensive conflicts of interest that pervade the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and the medical profession. This book is a wake-up call for physicians, policy-makers, and the public." --Senator Edward M. Kennedy<p></p><br>"<em>On the Take</em> should be required reading for anyone concerned about the future of medicine in this country. Kassirer has shined a much-needed spotlight on the dark underbelly of physicians' financial dealings with industry. He argues compellingly that the corrupting influence of money is now so entrenched that the medical profession alone may not be able to save itself from rank commercialism. Public outrage at the unconscionable practices documented in this book may be our only hope of redirecting the medical profession away from overweening self-interest and back towards its moral purpose--protecting patients' interests. If readers of this book are not outraged at what they learn, hope for a future of beneficent medicine may indeed be lost."--Jordan J. Cohen, M.D., President, Association of American Medical Colleges<p></p><br>"<em>On the Take</em> describes the web of financial interests that entangles many doctors and threatens their objectivity and professionalism. Equally bad, financial conflicts of interest can undermine public trust in doctors. In this book, Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer diagnoses the malady as systemic, widespread, and insidious. Dr. Kassirer's powerful account will make it hard for anyone to deny that a serious problem exists and demands attention. <em>On the Take</em> deserves to be read by everyone who has a stake in the future integrity of medicine and health care."--Harvey V. Fineberg, President, The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences<p></p><br>"Dr. Jerome Kassirer authoritatively describes the emerging immersion of the practice of medicine into the activities of the pharmaceutical and medical device world. As medicine itself has become a big business, the duties of the physician to the patient are in danger of being compromised and subverted.

Martin, M.D., Ph.D., Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Harvard University<p></p><br>"This important book provides a thoughtful, well-documented, and ultimately devastating expos� of the pervasive relationships between health care corporations, researchers and practicing physicians.

It&#39;s a clear-cut and straightforward chess opening that avoids the ever growing body of mainline theory. It&#39;s universal: Black can use the Hippo against virtually all of White choices: 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.c4, 1.f4, the Colle, London, Trompovsky, R�ti and others. It&#39;s not yet very well-known and will surprise many opponents. On top of all that, the Hippo is seriously underestimated: with its characteristic double Fianchetto, it may look quiet but is in fact a very dangerous animal. Alessio de Santis is one of the world&#39;s greatest experts and has written a practical, well-structured and accessible manual. His book can be studied on three levels: after a first flash of 3 to 4 hours you will be familiar with the Hippo&#39;s basic moves and key variations, its strategic themes and recurring manoeuvres. In the second and third phase De Santis leads you through the most important concrete lines and introduces the Semi-Hippopotamus to counter some specific White ideas. You can use the Hippo as a surprise weapon or as your main repertoire. The extensive explanations and clear conclusions make this book an easy-to-navigate manual for club players. If you like to confront your opponents with some unexpected counter-attacks, you need not look any further.</p><p>Alessio de Santis is a FIDE Master and one of the best known chess authors of Italy"This work is little short of a revelation. In advance of opening it up I was expecting something superficial, but once I delved into those murky waters where hippos dwell, I was impressed by De Santis's application. Just about all plausible structures that White may try are anticipated, examined and, consequently, appropriate antidotes are advised. De Santis really has come at his subject from all conceivable angles to leave no stone unturned. Did you know that the hippopotamus is the most dangerous of all animals? In chess opening terms, I would argue that it's also the case." (Glenn Flear <i>Yearbook 132</i>)<br><br>"Presents a very good view on the many ideas that the Hippopotamus offers.

Essentially a practical field manual for corrosion technicians and engineers, it is a simple and direct introduction to the fundamentals of a complex subject. <br><br>The contents cover soil resistivity surveys, potential surveys, line currents, current requirement surveys, rectifier systems for coated lines, ground bed design and installation, galvanic anodes on coated lines, hot spot protection, bond protection, stray current electrolysis, interference, operation and maintenance, and coating inspection and testing. There are also helpful appendixes that explain the fundamentals of underground corrosion, basic principles of cathodic protection, tables of properties of metals, and attenuation equations. <br><br>While other books on corrosion are sometimes too theoretical for practical work, Pipe Line Corrosion and Cathodic Protection, Third Edition, shows you how to take actual field measurements and apply them to design a well-protected system.</p><p>The late Marshall Parker was one of the world's foremost experts when it came to solutions to problems of pipe line corrosion and cathodic protection. Mr. Parker studied mathematics and physics and held degrees from Sam Houston State Teachers College and Rice University. He began his engineering studies with Houston Light and Power Co. He was a registered professional engineer in Texas and a consultant on pipe line corrosion for many years.

Over the past three decades, socialism has been replaced by pro-business policies as the way forward. And yet, in this &#39;new&#39; India, grinding poverty is still a feature of everyday life. Some 450 million people subsist on less than $1.25 per day and nearly half of India&#39;s children are malnourished. In his latest book, Atul Kohli, a seasoned scholar of Indian politics and economics, blames this discrepancy on the narrow nature of the ruling alliance in India that, in its newfound relationship with business, has prioritized economic growth above all other social and political considerations. In fact, according to Kohli, the resulting inequalities have limited the impact of growth on poverty alleviation, and the exclusion of such a significant proportion of Indians from the fruits of rapid economic growth is in turn creating an array of new political problems. This thoughtful and challenging book affords an alternative vision of India&#39;s rise in the world that its democratic rulers will be forced to come to grips with in the years ahead.</p><p>India has one of the fastest growing economies on earth.

In the 1990s a new field, evolutionary developmental biology (or evo-devo), was hailed as the synthesis of developmental and evolutionary biology. In From Embryology to Evo-Devo, historians, philosophers, sociologists, and biologists offer diverse perspectives on the history of efforts to understand the links between development and evolution. After examining events in the history of early twentieth century embryology and developmental genetics&#x2015;including the fate of Haeckel's law and its various reformulations, the ideas of William Bateson, and Richard Goldschmidt's idiosyncratic synthesis of ontogeny and phylogeny&#x2015;the contributors explore additional topics ranging from the history of comparative embryology in America to a philosophical-historical analysis of different research styles. Finally, three major figures in theoretical biology&#x2015;Brian Hall, Gerd M�ller, and G�nter Wagner&#x2015;reflect on the past and future of evo-devo, particularly on the interdisciplinary nature of the field.

He is also the only artist to ever receive Grammy Awards for music, lyrics, and orchestration. The wunderkind of pop music, Webb became the hottest songwriter around when, starting at age twenty-one, he wrote a string of hits recorded by Glen Campbell ("By the Time I Get to Phoenix," "Galveston"), The 5th Dimension ("Up, Up and Away"), and Richard Harris ("MacArthur Park"). The list of artists who have performed or recorded his songs over the years is a spectacular and varied one: Linda Ronstadt, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Johnny Cash, Carly Simon, Bob Dylan, Peggy Lee, Johnny Mathis, Roberta Flack, Ray Charles, Tony Bennett, Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson, Liza Minelli, and R.E.M. In addition to his prolific work with individuals, Webb has also made lasting musical contributions to the worlds of motion pictures, television, and theater. Now, Jimmy Webb uses the grace and eloquence that have characterized his lyrics to write Tunesmith, the ultimate book for aspiring songwriters -- the first ever with such an insider's knowledge and experience. With a combination of anecdotes, meditations, humor, and advice, Webb breaks down the entire process of creating a song from beginning to end, including coping with writer's block, song construction, rhyme schemes, chord progression, and the art of collaboration. He then goes beyond the techniques of song crafting and the realms of creativity to shed light on the machinations of marketing yourself, selling a song, and coping with big business, be it in Hollywood, Nashville, or on Broadway. Webb also provides a glimpse into the inner circle of the professional music world. From the legendary American songwriter Time magazine called &#x201c;our best revealer of the blind spots of the heart", Tunesmith is the new bible of songwriting.</p><p>A minister's son from Eld City, Oklahoma, <strong>Jimmy Webb</strong> has been writing songs for over twenty-five years. The only artist to receive Grammy Awards for music, lyrics, and orchestration, he is a member of the National Academy of Popular Music Songwriters' Hall of Fame and the Nashville Songwriters' Hall of Fame. According to BMI, his song "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" is the third most-performed song in the last fifty years, with "Up, Up and Away" on the same list in the Top Thirty. Jimmy Webb lives in New York State. For more information, visit Jimmy Webb's official website: www.jimmywebb.com.The only artist to receive Grammy Awards for music, lyrics and orchestration, Webb has written many of the most memorable songs performed by the Fifth Dimension ("Up, Up and Away"), Donna Summer ("MacArthur Park") and Amy Grant ("If These Walls Could Speak"), among others. Here he seeks to impart the tools of the trade to songwriters "who may be attempting the delicate transition from amateur to professional." Covering technical matters from basic chord theory and rhyme schemes to the protocol of pitching songs, Webb draws on a trove of personal anecdotes from a career spanning more than two decades. In addition to salient comments on today's music scene, Webb cites numerous examples from the past and includes sections on writing for the stage and film. Of greatest value, perhaps, are the exercises suggested for developing song ideas, which will help anyone stumbling through a period of writer's block. While Webb's fans will revel in the behind-the-scenes details of his career and a candid view of his artistic process, others may wish that the asides, finger pointing (at arrogant co-writers) and Webb's own pet peeves (e.g., no-talent spouses who insist on songwriting credits on their partner's records) had been left out. And Webb's nuts-and-bolts approach somehow undercuts every songwriter's need for that spark of absolute inspiration. For those interested in the latter, Songwriters on Songwriting: The Expanded Version (Da Capo, 1997), a collection of interviews between editor Paul Zollo and a variety of songwriters, including Webb, is the ticket. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cognitive Therapy of Borderline Personality Disorder (Psychology Practitioner Guidebooks)</h2><p>Hardcover,1993 Allyn and Bacon. 7th printing 1997.

Norman Cohn takes us back two thousand years to the world views of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India, the innovations of Iranian and Jewish prophets and sages, and the earliest Christian imaginings of heaven on earth, and he illuminates a major turning point in the history of human consciousness.</p><p><b>Norman Cohn</b> is professor emeritus at the University of Sussex and author of <i>Noah&#x2019;s Flood: The Genesis Story in Western Thought</i>, also published by Yale University Press.<br>An incisive study of ancient religion and the rise of belief in an impending apocalypse, by the author of the classic study The Pursuit of the Millennium. Cohn (Emeritus/University of Sussex) has puzzled for nearly a half century over where and when the idea first emerged of a ``marvelous consummation, when good will be finally victorious over evil'' and human beings will enjoy a new life on a purified earth. As he demonstrates through a sequence of succinct histories of ancient religious cultures, neither the Egyptians, Mesopotamians, nor Vedic Indians possessed the notion of apocalypse. Instead, each of these peoples imagined the world as a vastly ancient creation in which the guardians of order, or cosmos, are locked in an eternal stalemate with the agents of chaos. Typically, as in ancient Egypt, the principle of order became embodied in the state and its monarchy (Cohn tends to see tight parallels between religious and political developments). The great break came around 1200 B.C. with Zoroaster, who developed ``a totally new perception of time'' in which the combat between cosmos and chaos (or, on the moral plane, between good and evil) will culminate in the triumph of cosmos--a transformation termed ``the making wonderful,'' including the bodily resurrection of the elect. As Cohn shows, Zoroastrian thinking wound its way into Palestine, where it united with the monotheism of the Israelite prophet Second Isaiah--an event Cohn describes as ``a particularly ingenious response to a situation of permanent insecurity.'' The result was a huge corpus of Jewish apocalyptic literature that led eventually to Christian ideas of a transcendent Messiah and a Final Judgment, encoded most strikingly in the Book of Revelation. Cohn's tendency to see religion as disguised politics (he likens theologians to ``political propagandists'') stays largely in the background here: a tight, intelligent study. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The fifth edition&#39;s content is based on the best-selling texts PHYSICAL GEOLOGY: EXPLORING THE EARTH and HISTORICAL GEOLOGY: EVOLUTION OF EARTH AND LIFE THROUGH TIME, both written by James S. Monroe and Reed Wicander. Briefer than the previous edition and maintaining a consistent and clear writing style throughout, the text provides balanced coverage of physical and historical geology with engaging, real-life examples that draw you into the material. The fifth edition includes excellent illustrations, photographs, and maps that aid your understanding of this especially visual science. The book design presents the material in easily digestible chapters, with clear delineations between sections and well-placed artwork.</p><p>James S.

It takes an interdisciplinary approach that is both balanced and practical with six major areas of focus: the history of biblical interpretation, philosophical presuppositions, biblical genre, the uniqueness of Scripture, the practice of exegesis, and use of exegetical insights that will be lived and communicated in preaching and teaching.<br><br><i>Biblical Hermeneutics</i> is designed for students who have little or no knowledge of biblical interpretation. It provides, in one volume, resources for gaining a working knowledge of the multi-faceted nature of biblical interpretation and for supporting the practice of exegesis on the part of the student. The first chapter "A Student's Primer for Exegesis" by Bruce Corley gives the student a bird's eye view of the entire process. It becomes for the student a kind of template to which they will return again and again as they engage in the process of exegesis.<br><br>This revised edition of <i>Biblical Hermeneutics</i> contains seven new chapter that deal with the major literary genre of Scripture: law, narrative, poetry, wisdom, prophecy, Gospels and Acts, epistles, and apocalyptic. The unique nature of Scripture is presented in part three that addresses the authority, inspiration, and language of Scripture. The book contains two extensive appendices, "A Student's Glossary for Biblical Studies" and an updated and expanded version of "A Student's Guide to Reference Books and Biblical Commentaries. </p></p><p><b>&nbsp;Steve Lemke </b>es rector y profesor de Filosof�a y �tica en el Seminario Teol�gico Bautista de Nueva Orle�ns, Luisiana (EE.UU.).<br><br><b>Steve Lemke</b> is provost and professor of Philosophy and Ethics at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.</p><h2>Roman Imperialism: Readings and Sources</h2><p>This broad-ranging reader on Roman imperialism brings together ancient documents in translation and a selection of the best recent scholarly essays, in order to introduce students to the major problems and controversies in studying this central aspect of Roman history. <br> <ul> <li><br> </li> <li>A broad-ranging reader on Roman imperialism, combining ancient documents in translation and a selection of the best recent scholarship on the subject.<br> </li> <li>Introduces students to the major problems and controversies in the study of Roman imperialism.<br> </li> <li>Examines diverse aspects of Roman imperialism, from the Romans&#x2019; motivations in acquiring an empire and their ideological justifications for imperial domination, to the complex political, economic, and cultural interactions between the Romans, their allies, and the subjected peoples.<br> </li> <li>An introduction surveys modern work on Roman imperialism and provides the context of recent theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of empires in general.<br> </li> <li>Includes notes with suggestions for further reading.</li> </ul></p><p>Rome was founded as a tiny city-state on the Tiber, yet by the first century bc it ruled nearly the entire Mediterranean world.

As the expedition&#x2019;s geologist and naturalist, Darwin collected evidence from the Galapagos Islands and other locations which prompted him to speculate that species evolve over generations through a process of natural selection. In 1859, Darwin published <i>On the Origin of Species, </i>a work of scientific literature considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. His revolutionary work presented evidence from the <i>Beagle</i> expedition as well as from years of subsequent research and experimentation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Written for non-specialists, Darwin&#x2019;s book gained widespread interest from the scientific community, religious leaders, politicians and the general public. The theory Darwin presented in his book quickly became the subject of heated debate and discussion.

L.A.'s famous sprawl and very human neighborhoods, its uneasy meld of public and private spaces, its legendary gridlock, its organic and artificial environments, all feature in what is no less than the teasing out of a new and nuanced interpretation of the nature of 'urbanity&#x2019; itself."<br> &#x2014;Janet Fitch, author of <i>Paint It Black </i>and <i>White Oleander</i><br><br> "I see this book as a benign remake of [the movie]&nbsp;<i>Falling Down</i>.

As it is, <i>Sidewalking</i> has taken up welcome and necessary residence in my mind. And, to be&nbsp;precise, David Ulin doesn&#x2019;t argue on behalf of his adopted city.

In <b> <i> <b>Making the World Work Better: The Ideas That Shaped a Century and a Company</b> </i> </b>, journalists Kevin Maney, Steve Hamm, and Jeffrey M. O&#x2019;Brien mark the Centennial of IBM&#x2019;s founding by examining how IBM has distinctly contributed to the evolution of technology and the modern corporation over the past 100 years. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The authors offer a fresh analysis through interviews of many key figures, chronicling the Nobel Prize-winning work of the company&#x2019;s research laboratories and uncovering rich archival material, including hundreds of vintage photographs and drawings. The book recounts the company&#x2019;s missteps, as well as its successes. It captures moments of high drama &#x2013; from the bet-the-business gamble on the legendary System/360 in the 1960s to the turnaround from the company&#x2019;s near-death experience in the early 1990s. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The authors have shaped a narrative of discoveries, struggles, individual insights and lasting impact on technology, business and society. Taken together, their essays reveal a distinctive mindset and organizational culture, animated by a deeply held commitment to the hard work of progress.&nbsp;IBM engineers and scientists invented many of the building blocks of modern information technology, including the memory chip, the disk drive, the scanning tunneling microscope (essential to nanotechnology) and even new fields of mathematics. IBM brought the punch-card tabulator, the mainframe and the personal computer into the mainstream of business and modern life. IBM was the first large American company to pay all employees salaries rather than hourly wages, an early champion of hiring women and minorities and a pioneer of new approaches to doing business--with its model of the globally integrated enterprise. And it has had a lasting impact on the course of society from enabling the US Social Security System, to the space program, to airline reservations, modern banking and retail, to many of the ways our world today works. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The lessons for all businesses &#x2013; indeed, all institutions &#x2013; are powerful: To survive and succeed over a long period, you have to anticipate change and to be willing and able to continually transform. But while change happens, progress is deliberate. IBM &#x2013; deliberately led by a pioneering culture and grounded in a set of core ideas &#x2013; came into being, grew, thrived, nearly died, transformed itself... and is now charting a new path forward for its second century toward a perhaps surprising future on a planetary scale. </p></p><p>One hundred years ago, the company that would become IBM took its first steps into an unknown future. In <i>Making the World Work Better: The Ideas That Shaped a Century and a Company</i>, journalists Kevin Maney, Steve Hamm and Jeffrey M. O&#x2019;Brien tell a story of progress that illuminates, and transcends, the rich history of a single enterprise.<br> <br>Through extensive research, they explore IBM&#x2019;s impact on technology, on the evolving role of the modern corporation and on the way our world literally works. Most intriguingly, they uncover a set of compelling ideas whose greatest impact may lie not in the previous century, but in the next one&#x2014;ideas with the power to shape a surprising future, and to change the way we think.<p> <b>Kevin Maney </b>is the author of three critically-acclaimed books and was a reporter, editor and columnist at USA Today for 22 years and a contributing editor at Conde Nast Portfolio.

Also known as the <i>Posthomerica</i>, or "sequel to Homer," the <i>Trojan Epic</i> chronicles the course of the war after the burial of Troy's greatest hero, Hektor.</p><p>Quintus, believed to have been an educated Greek living in Roman Asia Minor, included some of the war's most legendary events: the death of Achilles, the Trojan Horse, and the destruction of Troy. But because Quintus deliberately imitated Homer's language and style, his work has been dismissed by many scholars as pastiche. </p><p>A vivid and entertaining story in its own right, the <i>Trojan Epic</i> is also particularly significant for what it reveals about its sources&#x2015;the much older, now lost Greek epics about the Trojan War known collectively as the Epic Cycle. Written in the Homeric era, these poems recounted events not included in the <i>Iliad</i> or the <i>Odyssey</i>. As Alan James makes clear in this vibrant and faithful new translation, Quintus's work deserves attention for its literary-historical importance and its narrative power. James's line-by-line verse translation in English reveals the original as an exciting and eloquent tale of gods and heroes, bravery and cunning, hubris and brutality. James includes a substantial introduction which places the work in its literary and historical context, a detailed and annotated book-by-book summary of the epic, a commentary dealing mainly with sources, and an explanatory index of proper names. Brilliantly revitalized by James, the <i>Trojan Epic</i> will appeal to a wide range of readers interested in Greek mythology and the legend of Troy.</p></p><p><p><b>Alan James</b> is Senior Lecturer in Classics emeritus at the University of Sydney.</p><p>"Provides a vivid retelling of events associated with the Trojan War subsequent to those outlined in the <i>Iliad</i>, but before those of the <i>Odyssey</i>&#x2015;a very attractive way of learning about a wide range of the details associated with this most famous of all mythological legends. Dr. James is one of half a dozen of the most accomplished scholars of late Greek poetry in the world. It is especially gratifying to discover that his skill as a translator matches that of his skill as a scholar."</p> (Peter Toohey, University of Calgary, Alberta)<br><br><p>"James's accessible, lively rendition of Quintus's poem deserves to alter the face of ancient epic studies... He fuses a flexible and nuanced form of the ancient hexameter rhythm with contemporary idiom. His <i>Posthomerica</i> includes a superb introduction, lucid commentary, bibliography, index of the occurrence of proper names, and summaries of the action of each Book... A landmark publication."</p> (Edith Hall <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br><p>"Amazingly, the first full-scale introduction to Quintus and his poem in English."</p> (Martijn Cuypers <i>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</i>)<br><br><p>"This third-century CE poem&#x2015;which deals with the events surrounding Homer's Iliad and Odyssey&#x2015;has been unfairly neglected and even denigrated by scholars more familiar with the Homeric epics. James attempts to rectify this situation in this comprehensive book."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Provides an excellent and accessible introduction, translation, and commentary for this neglected epic."</p> (Jean Alvares <i>Classical Outlook</i>)<br><br><p>"Through J.'s industry and scholarship Quintus is served well in this volume, which will generate interest in the <i>Trojan Epic</i> and pave the way for a much-needed literary reappraisal."</p> (Katerina Carvounis <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>Posthomerica</i> clearly aims to be a work of scholarship."</p> (Robert Schmiel <i>Mouseion: Journal of Classical Association of Canada</i>)</p><h2>Allegedly</h2><p><p><strong>4 starred reviews!</strong></p><p><em>Orange Is the New Black</em> meets Walter Dean Myer&#x2019;s <em>Monster</em> in this gritty, twisty, and haunting debut by Tiffany D.

This book is not only about illustration, though it does contain illustrations&#x2014;lots of them. But there&#x2019;s more. This book examines the profession of illustrator, from the vexing subject of money to the question of the right workplace. How do you get commissions? How do you negotiate successfully? What&#x2019;s a fair price? How do you handle the everyday routines involved in illustration work? It explains concepts such as usage rights, collecting societies and social security insurance for artists. And, of course, it presents a wide variety of illustration techniques. In short, it makes an effort to enlighten, be useful and answer as many questions as possible. Its author does so, on the one hand, by offering more than twenty really useful tips for budding illustrators&#x2014;for example, how to stop the fear that a blank page often inspires&#x2014;and, on the other, by presenting the twenty-five most important illustration techniques in a practical way that awakens the reader&#x2019;s desire to learn more. As a parallel narrative accompanying the humorous texts, there are images by very different illustrators who work with a wide variety of techniques and styles. These pictures are diverse yet easy to compare, because they all show the same thing: a bird. </p></p><p><p>Felix Scheinberger was born on 14 October 1969 in Frankfurt am Main (Germany).

The book traces for the first time the history of the underground revolutionary-republican grouping founded by the agrarian reformer, Thomas Spence. Challenging conventional distinctions between "high" and "low" culture, McCalman illuminates the darker, more populist sides of Romanticism. <em>Radical Underworld</em> broadens the conventional boundaries of popular politics and culture by exploring a political underworld connected with poverty, crime, prophetic religion, and literary culture.<br></p><p>Iain McCalman is at Australian National University.<br>"[A] beautifully researched and crafted book....It is a model for the cultural history of politics and popular entertainment."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Gives students a fascinating perspective on the underworld of British society.

J. Liebling in which he dubbed Chicago the "Second City." From garbage collection to the skyline, nothing escaped Liebling's withering gaze. Among the outraged responses from Chicago residents was one that Liebling described as the apotheosis of such criticism: a postcard that read, simply, "You were never in Chicago."<br><br> Neil Steinberg has lived in and around Chicago for more than three decades&#x2014;ever since he left his hometown of Berea, Ohio, to attend Northwestern&#x2014;yet he remains fascinated by the dynamics captured in Liebling's anecdote. In <i>You Were Never in Chicago</i> Steinberg weaves the story of his own coming-of-age as a young outsider who made his way into the inner circles and upper levels of Chicago journalism with a nuanced portrait of the city that would surprise even lifelong residents.<br><br> Steinberg takes readers through Chicago's vanishing industrial past and explores the city from the quaint skybridge between the towers of the Wrigley Building, to the depths of the vast Deep Tunnel system below the streets. He deftly explains the city's complex web of political favoritism and carefully profiles the characters he meets along the way, from greats of jazz and journalism to small-business owners just getting by. Throughout, Steinberg never loses the curiosity and close observation of an outsider, while thoughtfully considering how this perspective has shaped the city, and what it really means to belong. Intimate and layered, <i>You Were Never in Chicago </i>will be a welcome addition to the bookshelves of all Chicagoans, be they born in the city or forever transplanted.</p></p><p><b>Neil Steinberg</b> is a columnist at the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, where he has been on staff since 1987. He is the author of seven books, including<i> Drunkard: A Hard-Drinking Life</i> and <i>Hatless Jack: The President, the Fedora, and the History of American Style</i>.&nbsp;"[A] rollicking newspaperman's memoir . . . and a strong case for Second City exceptionalism." (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"A triumph." (Patrick Ryan <i>Toronto Star</i>)<br><br><p></p>&#x201c;In this wonderful book, Steinberg weaves a poetic mosaic of his life and the life of Chicago&#x2014;past, present, real, imagined. Like many of its citizens, he came here from elsewhere, drawn by its brawny allure. He lives in Chicago and Chicago lives in him.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roger Ebert (<i>Roger Ebert</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;I grew up in Chicago. And reading <i>You Were Never in Chicago</i> reminds me why I still think of Chicago as home even though I haven&#x2019;t lived in the city for more than twenty years.&nbsp;Steinberg brilliantly explores the historical and contemporary city and how each of us makes (or loses) our way in it.&nbsp;Whether you're a native or you just arrived at O'Hare, read this book: it will make you feel at home in Chicago. Even better, it will you make Chicago yours.&#x201d; (<i>Dan Savage</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A lot of people have tried to take the measure of Chicago, capture it between the covers of a book. Many more have failed than have been successful, and that&#x2019;s easy to understand. Chicago is ever elusive. But this writer and this book get it. If you know Neil Steinberg from his <i>Sun-Times</i> column, and God love you for still reading a newspaper, you will not be unfamiliar with the high quality and distinctive style of his writing. But here you will also find people and places and sentiments that will surprise, enlighten, and entertain you. It is, of course, his own take on the city. And it&#x2019;s a keeper.&#x201d; (<i>Rick Kogan</i>)<br><br><p>"Despite his long residence in the city and its suburbs, Steinberg feels and writes as an outsider, which allows him to see and describe aspects of Chicago from a fresh and enthusiastic perspective....This is a well-done paean to a diverse, vibrant metropolis."</p><p></p> (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"Like Studs Terkel before him, Steinberg mixes memoir, history, and travelogue in&nbsp;<i>You Were Never in Chicago&nbsp;</i>as he takes readers along on an engaging tour of the characters&#x2014;and character&#x2014;of his adopted city, past and present."

Envisioned in 1947 but not completed until the mid-1960s, the arch today attracts millions of tourists annually and is one of the world&#x2019;s most widely recognized structures. By weaving together social, political, and cultural history, historian Tracy Campbell uncovers the complicated and troubling history of the beloved structure. This&nbsp;compelling book explores how a medley of players with widely divergent motivations (civic pride, ambition,&nbsp;greed, among others) brought the Gateway Arch to fruition, but at a price the city continues to pay.<br> &nbsp;<br> Campbell dispels long-held myths and casts a provocative new light on the true origins and meaning of the Gateway Arch. He shows that the monument was the scheme of shrewd city leaders who sought to renew downtown St. Louis and were willing to steal an election, destroy historic buildings, and drive out local people and businesses to achieve their goal. Campbell also tells the human story of the architect Eero Saarinen, whose prize-winning design brought him acclaim but also charges of plagiarism, and who never lived to see the completion of his vision. As a national symbol, the Gateway Arch has a singular place in American culture, Campbell concludes, yet it also stands as an instructive example of failed urban planning.</p><p>This book is the first to explore the colorful history of the spectacular Gateway Arch of St. Louis and the controversial tactics of its creators. Beloved as a symbol of American democracy, the monument can also be seen as a vivid example of failed urban planning.<b>Tracy Campbell</b> is professor of history and codirector of the Wendell Ford Public Policy Research Center at the University of Kentucky.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ghost Stories (Macmillan Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>Designed to appeal to the book lover, the Macmillan Collector's Library is a series of beautifully bound pocket-sized gift editions of much loved classic titles.

Even in his first successful work, <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, you will find five ghost stories, all of which are included in this collection. Dickens began the tradition of the &#x2018;ghost story at Christmas&#x2019;, and many of his tales in this genre are presented here including the brilliant novella, &#x2018;The Haunted Man and the Ghost&#x2019;s Bargain&#x2019;, which deserves to be as well-known as <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. While all his supernatural tales aim to chill the spine, they are not without the usual traits of Dickens&#x2019; flamboyant style, his subtle wit, biting irony, humorous incidents and moral observations. It is a mixture which makes these stories fascinating and entertaining as well as unsettling. To paraphrase the Fat Boy in <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>: Charles Dickens &#x2018;wants to make your flesh creep&#x2019;.</p><p>This collection brings together all Dickens' ghost stories - twenty in all - including several long tales. Here are chilling histories of coincidence, insanity and revenge. </p><p>Illustrated by various artists, with an afterword by David Stuart Davies.</p></p><p>Charles Dickens was born in 1812 near Portsmouth, where his father worked as a clerk. Living in London in 1824, Dickens was sent by his family to work in a blacking-warehouse, and his father was arrested and imprisoned for debt. Fortunes improved and Dickens returned to school, eventually becoming a parliamentary reporter. His first piece of fiction was published by a magazine in December 1832, and by 1836 he had begun his first novel, <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>. He focused his career on writing, completing fourteen highly successful novels, as well as penning journalism, shorter fiction and travel books. He died in 1870.</p><h2>Research Methodology: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners</h2><p><p>The Third Edition of Research Methodology: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners integrates various quantitative and qualitative methodologies into eight practice-based-steps, providing lots of examples throughout to link theory with practice.

This book is testament to de Martino&#x2019;s innovation and engagement with Hegelian historicism and phenomenology&#x2014;a work of ethnographic theory way ahead of its time.</p> <p>This new translation of <i>Sud e Magia</i>, his 1959 study of ceremonial magic and witchcraft in southern Italy, shows how De Martino is not interested in the question of whether magic is rational or irrational but rather in why it came to be perceived as a problem of knowledge in the first place. Setting his exploration within his wider, pathbreaking theorization of ritual, as well as in the context of his politically sensitive analysis of the global south&#x2019;s historical encounters with Western science, he presents the development of magic and ritual in Enlightenment Naples as a paradigmatic example of the complex dynamics between dominant and subaltern cultures. Far ahead of its time, <i>Magic</i> is still relevant as anthropologists continue to wrestle with modernity&#x2019;s relationship with magical thinking.</p> <p></p> <br></p><p><p><b>Ernesto de Martino </b>(1908-65) was a prominent anthropologist and historian of religions in Italy. <b>Dorothy Louise Zinn</b> is associate professor of cultural anthropology at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Italy.&nbsp;</p><br>"Perhaps because he was uniquely equipped to bridge the chasm between philological folklore studies and the field orientation of anthropology, Ernesto de Martino was also a pioneer in his recognition of both the theoretical capacities of ordinary people and the historical formation of ideas&#x2014;notably magic&#x2014;that are often presented as existing in a timeless past. His encyclopedic knowledge gives substance to a careful exploration of the dynamics that conjoin subaltern with hegemonic cultural forms and practices, leading us, in a remarkable anticipation of current anthropological views, to a reflexive reappraisal of the meanings of 'rationality' and 'Enlightenment.' Dorothy Louise Zinn&#x2019;s precise and lucid translation brings a clear focus to the originality as well as the groundedness of de Martino&#x2019;s observations on the role of social agency and historical contingency in the operation of thought and reason." (Michael Herzfeld, Harvard University, author of&nbsp;Evicted from Eternity: The Restructuring of Modern Rome)<br><br>"Written half a century ago, de Martino&#x2019;s theory of magic has been a well-kept secret. No longer. In these pages de Martino lays out his view of magic as a technique for combating precarity&#x2014;'the negative,' as he refers to it&#x2014;in the Southern Italian situation of marginality and impoverishment. In an early twenty-first century where the economic circumstances of so many people have 'gone south,' de Martino&#x2019;s existentialist ideas of crisis, risk, and the 'loss of presence' have wider applicability than he could have imagined."

In it, Edmund Gosse recounts, with humor and pathos, his childhood as a member of a Victorian Protestant sect and his struggles to forge his own identity despite the loving control of his father. His work is a key document of the crisis of faith and doubt and a penetrating exploration of the impact of evolutionary science. An astute, well-observed, and moving portrait of the tensions of family life, <em>Father and Son</em> remains a classic of twentieth-century literature.<br><br>This edition contains an illuminating introduction, and provides a series of fascinating appendices including extracts from Philip Gosse's <em>Omphalos</em> and Edmund Gosse's harrowing account of his wife's death from breast cancer.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Most of us take for granted our right to choose the life of the mind over that of the spirit without feeling remorse. At the very least, we've learned that the two need not be mutually exclusive. But this is hard-won ease, born of a conflict that began with the Victorians. Edmund Gosse's <i>Father and Son</i> (1907) traces his own reckoning--as well as that of his father, the eminent British zoologist Philip Gosse--with the clash. His story is, as he declares, "The diagnosis of a dying Puritanism."<p> The only Puritanism that dies here, however, is the author's. His parents were Christian fundamentalists and as a result, young Edmund was denied interaction with other children as well as all variety of fictional tales. "Here was perfect purity," Gosse writes, "perfect intrepidity, perfect abnegation; yet there was also narrowness, isolation, and absence of perspective, let it boldly be admitted, an absence of humanity." Despite all of this, the child maintained his sense of humor, which adds much levity to a tale of such potentially grim proportions.</p><p> When Edmund was 8, his mother died of cancer, leaving him the care of a man in whom "sympathetic imagination ... was singularly absent." Philip Gosse held on to his faith in God above all else--so much so, in fact, that when evolutionary theory was announced to the world, he dismissed it entirely because it discounted the book of Genesis. Little by little, Edmund began to chafe against the traditions he had inherited. By the age of 11, he already saw himself "imprisoned for ever in the religious system which had caught me and would whurl my helpless spirit." At this point he believed his fate was sealed and went through the motions of piety. It is not until he goes off to boarding school, and discovers the Greeks and Romantic poetry, that he slowly chooses his own path. Eventually he comes to realize that he and his father "walked in opposite hemispheres of the soul." Their split encapsulates a particular moment in history but also embodies their destiny: "one was born to fly backward, the other could not help being carried forward." <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Michael Newton is Lecturer in English at University College London.</p><h2>Understanding Statistical Analysis and Modeling</h2><p><p><strong>Understanding Statistical Analysis and Modeling</strong> is for readers in the social, behavioral, or managerial sciences mathematics to understand the logic of statistical analysis.

Exploring the full range of gender issues, this book offers a fresh perspective on everyday experiences of gender; the explicit and implicit attitudes that underlie beliefs about gender differences; and the consequences for our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. Many real-world examples illustrate how the unique interdependence of men and women&#x2014;coupled with pervasive power imbalances&#x2014;shapes interactions in romantic relationships and the workplace. In the process, the authors shed new light on the challenges facing those who strive for gender parity. This ideal student text takes readers to the cutting edge of gender theory and research.<p></p></p><p><p>Laurie A. Rudman, PhD, is Professor of Psychology at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Her research interests are intergroup relations and implicit social cognition. The author of more than 40 professional publications, she is currently associate editor of<i> Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</i>. Her honors and awards include the National Research Service Award from the National Institutes of Health and (with Eugene Borgida) the Gordon Allport Prize from the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. Dr. Rudman is an honorary Fellow of the American Psychological Association, the Association for Psychological Science, and the Society of Experimental Social Psychology, for which she currently serves on the Executive Committee. She also serves on the Advisory Council for the National Science Foundation and is a representative on the board of the Federation of Behavioral, Psychological, and Cognitive Sciences. Dr. Rudman has served as an expert witness in several workplace discrimination cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Peter Glick, PhD, is Professor of Psychology and the Henry Merritt Wriston Professor in the Social Sciences at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. His research focuses on prejudice and stereotyping, particularly ambivalent prejudices. Along with Susan T. Fiske, he won the Gordon Allport Prize for developing the theory and measurement of ambivalent sexism. The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory has since been administered to tens of thousands of people in over 25 nations. These cross-cultural studies have shown that subjectively benevolent, but traditional, beliefs about women are associated with hostility toward nontraditional women, and with actual gender inequality. Dr. Glick is on the editorial boards of four professional journals and has been elected a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, the Association for Psychological Science, and the Society for the Psychology of Women. He is also on the Executive Councils (and a Fellow) of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology and the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. </p><p>"An engaging, informative, and broad-ranging text by two scholars who have been leaders in explaining the central paradox of gender relations: pervasive inequality in the apparent absence of malice. Much work in this field tends to oversimplify or brush aside the complexities of gender relations, but Rudman and Glick muster a wide range of research that clarifies these ambiguities. The book systematically presents theoretical interpretations from three different schools of thought: evolutionary psychology, culture/role theory, and social structural theory. Ideal for classroom use as well as for anyone who wants to learn about important new directions in research on gender dynamics."--Mary R. Jackman, PhD, Department of Sociology, University of California, Davis</p><p>"The best text I've seen to date on how gender influences social interaction. The authors have organized the extensive research in this area into coherent, compelling chapters. The writing style is not merely clear and interesting, but is also appealing, convincing, and incisive. This book will engage students readily and teach them how to understand and analyze the impact of gender on everyday life. Their beliefs about social interaction will be forever changed. This excellent, well-organized text is accessible enough that it could be used in courses at any level."--Alice H. Eagly, PhD, Department of Psychology, Northwestern University</p><p>"This book is a splendidly engaging, highly intelligent review of psychological research on gender. Taking the stance that issues of gender are unique, marked by both power and status differences and intimate interdependence, it explores the complexity and apparent contradictions in how men and women are regarded and how they relate to one another. The review is comprehensive, the writing lively, and the insights plentiful. A 'must read' for all students of gender. I plan to use this book in my undergraduate course."--Madeline E. Heilman, PhD, Department of Psychology, New York University</p><br><br>"Although the social psychology of the interactions between men and women is complicated (and the authors make no attempt to over-simplify it), this book is an easy and enjoyable read. The authors weave together evolutionary, cultural, and social role theories in a narrative format. This allows the book to read more like a novel than a list of research. The authors also provide a unique perspective on gender interactions by tying together research from a variety of domains with their underlying theory of hostility vs. interdependence and the ambivalence that this engenders in men and women towards the other sex....The text would be ideal for a graduate level psychology of gender course or even as a supplemental text for a class on intergroup relations. In addition to its use in the classroom, The Social Psychology of Gender would also be an excellent reference for social psychologists or gender researchers to have on their shelf." (<i>Sex Roles</i> 2010-05-16)<br><br>"Written in a narrative fashion as accessible to the reader with no &nbsp;scientific training as to the scholar seeking an introduction to the &nbsp;current state of the literature on gender, the book integrates a diverse &nbsp;array of findings on development, cognition, and culture to develop the &nbsp;empirical foundations for a detailed understanding of the authors' &nbsp;particular theoretical perspective on gender relations....The authors' &nbsp;use of a coherent, overarching theoretical framework to connect and make &nbsp;sense of the findings from a large and often bewildering array of &nbsp;studies on gender is a strength of this volume....A useful guide to &nbsp;understanding the origins of inequality and the barriers that impede &nbsp;efforts to eliminate it."

Now in a greatly expanded, second edition, this book relates fractals and chaos to a variety of geological and geophysical applications. All concepts are introduced at the lowest possible level of mathematics consistent with their understanding, so that the reader requires only a background in basic physics and mathematics.&#39;This book ... provides fundamental concepts of fractals and chaotic dynamics. It introduces the related concepts of multifractals, self-similar time series, wavelets, and self-organised critically ... The author has done a magnificent job in presenting advanced material in a simplified manner. It is obvious that Turcotte is an excellent teacher.&#39; Frederik P. Agterberg, Computers and Geosciences</p><h2>A Pitch of Philosophy: Autobiographical Exercises (The Jerusalem-Harvard Lectures)</h2><p>What is the pitch of philosophy? Something thrown, for us to catch? A lurch, meant to unsettle us? The relative position of a tone on a scale? A speech designed to persuade? This book is an invitation to the life of philosophy in the United States, as Emerson once lived it and as Stanley Cavell now lives it - in all its topographical ambiguity. Cavell talks about his vocation in connection with what he calls voice - the tone of philosophy - and his right to take that tone, and to describe an anecdotal journey toward the discovery of his own voice.<br>Cavell asks how the voice of philosophy can be heard amid the commerce of everyday life. His autobiographical exercises begin at home with his parents, his father an accidental pawnbroker and accomplished raconteur, his mother a trained and talented musician. In the course of showing us his certain steps in the discovery of his trade, he conveys the sense of what it means to learn to walk on one's own, with a Thoreauvian deliberateness. He pays suitable attention to a serious ally and antagonist to the task of philosophy as he understands it, namely, Jacques Derrida - yet Derrida has mounted a full-scale attack on "voice" and other concepts that Cavell has held open for much of a lifetime.<br>The chapters are interwoven with intense family reminiscences in Cavell's discovery of J. L. Austin, his understanding of Wittgenstein, his raising of Emerson to the philosophical canon, his fascination with film (images of women in a medium for women), the revelation that film and opera are the media of otherness for women. And the voice at the end: hearing in himself the voice of his mother, which is music.<br>Complex, sentimental, witty, A Pitch of Philosophy is for anyone who cares to take on philosophy, under whatever name it goes.</p><p><b>Stanley Cavell</b> is Walter M. Cabot Professor, Emeritus, of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value, Harvard University.The autobiographical note of Cavell's philosophy, here as in his other writings, evokes an atmosphere of fragility and danger...Whether in the discussion of the haunting of Hamlet, or in the analysis of inheritance in the film <i>Gaslight</i> in which `something is resounding', or even in the reflections on the `necessarily forged' signatures of ghosts, Cavell presents an understated but powerful analysis of a world and a self haunted by voices...Cavell's work extends philosophy into other domains...His autobiographical exercises exemplify `humane criticism' applied to philosophy, remaining true to the technical demands of the discipline and paying heed to the claims of the experience that sustains it.<br> --Howard Caygill (<i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br>Stanley Cavell is among the very few philosophers in America to have achieved a major reputation primarily through writing on the arts, and perhaps the only one to have evolved a prose style that has something of the character of artistic expression in its own right...The author's voice kept--keeps--ringing in my inadequately pitched ear.<br> --Arthur C. Danto (<i>ArtForum</i>)<br><br>Cavell has carried on the tradition of Wittgenstein and John Austin into new areas of philosophy and literature...The present work is both an intellectual autobiography and a philosophy of the autobiography, in which he defends the authority of the personal voice. Of most philosophical interest is a long account, part actual, part possible, of an exchange between Austin and Derrida with Cavell's own voice as adjudicator much in evidence.

As a child, he spent much of his free time in that city&#39;s famous Hagenbeck Zoo drawing animals. After serving in the army during World War I, he studied philology and natural science at the University of Hamburg. He then married Margret Rey and they moved to Montmartre for four years. The manuscript for the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and Curious George was published in 1941. Curious George has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.Written by the author of Curious George, this hefty guide to stars, constellations, and planets in the night sky was first published in 1952 and revised several times, though the current book is evidently the first to be called the second edition. A star on the jacket proclaims &#x201c;updated star and solar system information.&#x201d; Inside, additions include an introductory note on Pluto, which explains the difference between a planet and a dwarf planet, as well as a paragraph on the Kuiper Belt. Information on the solar system and the asteroid belt has been revised in the light of Pluto&#x2019;s reclassification. In addition, the planetary tables have been updated through 2016. The bibliography was not updated, however, and it includes no books from the last 10&nbsp;years. Still, the new edition is recommended to replace old ones in astronomy collections.</p><h2>Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece</h2><p><p><i>Men of Bronze</i> takes up one of the most important and fiercely debated subjects in ancient history and classics: how did archaic Greek hoplites fight, and what role, if any, did hoplite warfare play in shaping the Greek polis? In the nineteenth century, George Grote argued that the phalanx battle formation of the hoplite farmer citizen-soldier was the driving force behind a revolution in Greek social, political, and cultural institutions. Throughout the twentieth century scholars developed and refined this grand hoplite narrative with the help of archaeology. But over the past thirty years scholars have criticized nearly every major tenet of this orthodoxy. Indeed, the revisionists have persuaded many specialists that the evidence demands a new interpretation of the hoplite narrative and a rewriting of early Greek history. <i>Men of Bronze</i> gathers leading scholars to advance the current debate and bring it to a broader audience of ancient historians, classicists, archaeologists, and general readers.</p><br><p> After explaining the historical context and significance of the hoplite question, the book assesses and pushes forward the debate over the traditional hoplite narrative and demonstrates why it is at a crucial turning point. Instead of reaching a consensus, the contributors have sharpened their differences, providing new evidence, explanations, and theories about the origin, nature, strategy, and tactics of the hoplite phalanx and its effect on Greek culture and the rise of the polis.</p><br><p> The contributors include Paul Cartledge, Lin Foxhall, John Hale, Victor Davis Hanson, Donald Kagan, Peter Krentz, Kurt Raaflaub, Adam Schwartz, Anthony Snodgrass, Hans van Wees, and Gregory Viggiano.</p></p><p><p>"This is the new hoplite book everyone has been waiting for--punchy, stimulating, up-to-date, and full of excitement and contention, like a hoplite scrum."<b>--John Ma, University of Oxford</b></p><p>"Controversies of great interest surround the topic of hoplite warfare and its connections to Greek society and culture.

John Reader's lifelong passion for this quest--palaeoanthropology--began when he reported on the celebrated "Lucy" finds in Ethiopia, for <em>Life Magazine</em>. Drawing on both historic and recent research, he tells the fascinating story of the science as it has developed from the activities of a few dedicated individuals, into the rigorous multidisciplinary work of today. His arresting photographs give a unique insight into the fossils, the discoverers, and the settings. His vivid narrative reveals both the context in which our ancestors evolved, and also the realities confronting the modern scientist. The story he tells is peopled by eccentrics and enthusiasts, and punctuated by controversy and even fraud. It is a celebration of discoveries--<em>Neanderthal Man</em> in the 1850s, <em>Java Man</em> (1891), <em>Australopithecus</em> (1925), <em>Peking Man</em> (1926), <em>Homo habilis</em> (1964) and beyond. It is a story of fragmentary shards of evidence, and the competing interpretations built upon them. And it is a tale of scientific breakthroughs--dating technology, genetics and molecular biology--that have enabled us to set the fossil evidence in the context of human evolution. <br><br>Boasting seventy-five original color photographs--taken by the author, specifically for this book--<em>Missing Links</em> offers a wealth of scientific insight.</p><p><br><strong>John Reader</strong> is a writer and photographer with more than fifty years of professional experience.

The circumstances in which individuals or entire peoples are compelled to leave their homeland are as various as they are numerous, and how people react to exile also varies widely. Think of the wit of Alexander Herzen, or the quiet despair of Oscar Wilde, sitting outside the Cafe' de Flore in the Boulevard St. Germain in the hope that someone will pay for his coffee, or the comfortable life of Sir Richard and Lady Burton in their <em>garconnerie</em> in Trieste, or the angst of Albert Camus, or the wanderings of Jack Kerouac. Now, in <em>The Oxford Book of Exile</em>, John Simpson has brought together examples of exile from all over the world, and from all periods of history.<br> Here is an intense record of the experience of exile, with writers from Ovid to Solzhenitsyn describing their emotions, their struggle, and their despair. For those who have chosen a life in exile, Simpson shows how the response is more mixed: ambivalence about the country they have left and the country they have chosen suffuses the writing of these intellectuals. We read of literary expatriates, such as Henry James, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Henry Miller, and James Joyce. There is also the happy life of exiles in utterly foreign places, such as Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa or Paul Gauguin in Tahiti. And those persecuted for their faith--such as the Pilgrims at Plymouth or the Ayatollah Khomeini in France--rub shoulders with those fleeing from war, or from debt, or even from the weather.<br> Castaways and spies, premiers and princes describe their departure, their reception, and sometimes their return, in an anthology that is by turns inspiring, moving, and deeply thought-provoking. With sources ranging from police records, newspaper articles, interviews, letters, and memoirs, as well as verse and fiction, and settings as remote as Iran and Russia, China and Palestine, <em>The Oxford Book of Exile</em> provides fascinating insight into an experience that touches so many, and captures the imagination of us all.<br></p><p>From the moment Adam and Eve were expelled from Paradise, exile has been a part of the human experience.

For them, being left outside the gates of the "White City" merely underscored a more general exclusion from America's bright future.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibits at the fair were controlled by all-white committees, and those that acknowledged African Americans at all, such as the famous Aunt Jemima pancake exhibit, ridiculed and denigrated them. Many African Americans saw the racist policies of the World's Columbian Exposition as mirroring, framing, and reinforcing the larger horrors confronting blacks throughout the United States, where white supremacy meant segregation, second-class citizenship, and sometimes mob violence and lynching.&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to the politics of exclusion that governed the fair, and of its larger implications, several prominent African Americans resolved to publish a pamphlet that would catalog the achievements of African Americans since the abolition of slavery while articulating the persistent political economy of apartheid in the American South. The authors of this remarkable document included the antilynching crusader Ida B. Wells, the former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, the educator Irvine Garland Penn, and the lawyer and newspaper publisher Ferdinand L. Barnett. An eloquent statement of protest and pride, <i>The Reason Why the Colored American Is Not in the World's Columbian Exposition</i> reminds us that struggles over cultural representation are nothing new in American life. Robert Rydell's introduction provides insight into the sometimes conflicting strategies employed by African Americans as they strove to represent themselves at a cultural event that was widely regarded as a defining moment in American history.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Robert W.

This book explores Venice's magnetic hold on the imagination of the Grand Tourist and connects the ideology of the Tour to the mythology of Venice.<br>According to Bruce Redford, the Tour offered a heady combination of aesthetic, social political, and sexual experience, and it provided its alumni with a life-long source of cultural and political authority. Yet from the beginning the Tour was also viewed with deep suspicion: it was feared that the very experiences that completed the British gentleman might well undo him.<br>The aspiration and ambivalence that characterize the Tour attached themselves most powerfully to the experience of Venice. Drawing on a wide range of materials - from guidebooks to portraits, from satirical poems to garden pavilions - Redford investigates Venice's power of attraction for the British, and shows that it was a source of many echoes and metaphors of Britain's own cultural, political, and geographical situation.</p><p>Redford (English, Univ. of Chicago) examines the uses of the "grand tour" of France and Italy for young English gentlemen of the period 1650-1800, explaining why it was held in contempt as well as in high regard. He enumerates the social, artistic, political, and moral aspects of the tour and shows how Venice epitomized the tour's many facets. Redford illuminates the literature, political writings, and even the portraiture of the period, illuminates the influences that the entire experience had on the Englishman travelers who would later be among the most important names in Britain, e.g., Edward Gibbon, Adam Smith, Horace Walpole, and Thomas Gray. This volume serves as a valuable preface to such works as John Pemble's Venice Rediscovered (Oxford Univ., 1995), which addresses the period beginning in 1800.

It&#x2019;s that serious one that makes my bottom lip wobble. &#x201c;I need you to go back inside, sit down in our booth, and ask that nice waitress for another piece of that pecan pie you like so much,&#x201d; he says slowly, evenly.<br> <br>I swallow back my tears. &#x201c;Alone?&#x201d;<br> <br>His face tightens, like he&#x2019;s mad. &#x201c;Only for a little bit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And then you&#x2019;ll come in?&#x201d;<br> <br>He squeezes his eyes shut and I&#x2019;m afraid I just made him really angry, but . . . I&#x2019;ve never gone anywhere alone. I&#x2019;m only five. &#x201c;Remember that Daddy loves you, baby girl. Now go on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stifling back a sob, I slide along the old bench seat and push the heavy old Ford truck door open.<br> <br>&#x201c;Reesie,&#x201d; Daddy calls out as my red shoes hit the sidewalk.<br> <br>Turning, I see his hand wiping at something on his cheek before he gives me a wink and a smile. The truck door makes a loud bang as I swing it tight. Holding my breath, I climb the steps and push as hard as I can against the diner door, the jangle of the bell ringing in my ears. I dart across the black-and-white checkered floor and climb into our booth&#x2014;the one we were sitting in before Daddy called Mommy; it still has our dishes on the table&#x2014;just in time to see the taillights of Daddy&#x2019;s truck disappear.<br> <br>When the nice waitress with the big hair comes by, I tell her my daddy will be here soon and I order that piece of chocolate pecan pie with a please and thank you. I sit in that booth and gobble it up, thinking how lucky I am to get two pieces in one night.<br> <br>And I wait.<br> <br>With my chin resting on my palm, tucked into the corner of the booth, I stare out that window, watching for the familiar blue truck to reappear, checking the door every time that bell jangles. When the kind policeman sits down across from me and asks me where my daddy is, I tell him he&#x2019;ll be here soon.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no kind policeman to comfort me now. No nice lady bringing me a piece of chocolate pecan pie to combat the sourness in my mouth. But at least this time I wasn&#x2019;t abandoned.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m reminded of that the second I see my stepfather&#x2019;s face through the small glass window in the door.<br> <br>His salt-and-pepper hair is more salt than pepper and he&#x2019;s gained at least ten pounds around his waist since I last saw him&#x2014;nine years ago&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s no mistaking Jack Warner. I don&#x2019;t think he recognizes me, though. The way his steely blue eyes wander over my violet hair . . . my piercings . . . the giant &#x201c;Jared&#x201d; tattoo that coils around my right shoulder, I think he&#x2019;s wondering if the police officer led him into the wrong room.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m lucky that I&#x2019;m even in a room this time. Normally they throw you into a holding cell or make you sit in an uncomfortable chair next to a drunk named Seth who stinks of malt scotch and body odor. I&#x2019;m pretty sure the female arresting officer felt sorry for me. By the lethal glare she threw at Jared and Caroline as I was escorted out of Lina&#x2019;s apartment, past their apartment door, on my way to the cruiser, the officer wasn&#x2019;t impressed with what she&#x2019;d heard of the situation.<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t hear it from me, of course. Growing up around lawyers, I&#x2019;ve learned not to say a word to the police without one present. It was my best friend and next-door neighbor, Lina, who declared that the apartment I trashed earlier today is still technically mine&#x2014;even if my name isn&#x2019;t on the lease&#x2014;and that they should be arresting the thieving, heartless bitch who stole my husband.<br> <br>Unfortunately, I&#x2019;m the only one sitting here now.<br> <br>I hold my breath as I watch Jack take a seat, adjusting his slightly rumpled suit jacket on his large frame as he tries to get comfortable in the hard plastic chair. It&#x2019;s ironic&#x2014;in this moment, it feels like he&#x2019;s both an integral part of my childhood and a complete stranger.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t believe I called him.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t believe he actually came.<br> <br>With a heavy sigh, he finally murmurs, &#x201c;Reese&#x2019;s Pieces.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s looking down at me the same way he did when I got caught rearranging the letters of a Baptist church sign to read something no nine-year-old girl&#x2014;or twenty-year-old, for that matter&#x2014;should have in her vocabulary. Despite the severe strain in our once close relationship, warmth immediately spreads through my chest. I haven&#x2019;t heard that nickname in years. &#x201c;So . . . destruction of private property?&#x201d;<br> <br>I guess the cops filled him in. &#x201c;I prefer to call it artistic expression.&#x201d; The canvas included Caroline&#x2019;s prissy clothes, her pretentious throw cushions, and that damn pornographic picture of them hanging over our bed. &#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; I raise my hands, stained in crimson, and offer in a deadpan tone, &#x201c;they can&#x2019;t prove it was me.&#x201d; When Lina found me sitting quietly in the dim kitchen light of her apartment, where I&#x2019;ve been staying for the past two weeks, she let out a single yelp before realizing that I hadn&#x2019;t turned into a homicidal maniac and was in fact covered in red paint. I probably should have made the cops&#x2019; job harder and showered before they arrived.<br> <br>A tiny sad smile creeps over his face. I wonder if my attempt at humor adequately hides the crushing heartbreak and rejection that I&#x2019;m drowning in after finding out my husband was having an affair with his high school sweetheart.<br> <br>&#x201c;I phoned Barry on my way here. Sounds like you&#x2019;ve kept him busy these past few years.&#x201d; By his clenching jaw, I see that wasn&#x2019;t an easy call for Jack to make, even nine years later. Not surprising. Friends since they could barely walk, Jack and Barry were once equity partners together in his law firm. Until Barry had an affair with Jack&#x2019;s wife.<br> <br>My mother.<br> <br>All relationships instantly dissolved in a bath of bitterness that obviously hasn&#x2019;t fully drained yet. Glancing at his hand, I can&#x2019;t help but notice the absence of a wedding ring. I guess he hasn&#x2019;t remarried. After what my mother put him through, I don&#x2019;t blame him.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I understand why you called me now. You didn&#x2019;t have a choice, did you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; I admit, focusing on the stars and circles I&#x2019;m finger-drawing over the table&#x2019;s cold metal surface. Barry is a high-priced, successful criminal lawyer who has gotten his unruly stepdaughter out of more than one debacle. The last incident was on my eighteenth birthday when I decided it would be funny to go retro and moon cars.<br> <br>One of those cars was a police cruiser.<br> <br>The cop was an uptight prick.<br> <br>And I was drunk.<br> <br>After helping me avoid indecent exposure and underage public drunkenness charges, Barry announced that my juvenile record was sealed, I was now an adult, and he was officially washing his hands of me. Three months later, when my mother left him for husband number four, it really became official.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised Annabelle&#x2019;s new husband didn&#x2019;t want this swept under the rug quickly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t phone Annabelle. I don&#x2019;t want her to know about this.&#x201d; I stopped calling her &#x201c;Mom&#x201d; when I was eight. We both agreed it wasn&#x2019;t fitting for a woman whose true passions lay in exclusive club status and dirty martinis.<br> <br>My doodling finger freezes suddenly. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t phone her, did you?&#x201d; That would be like handing her torpedoes for an effective insult air strike. She had called it after all. She&#x2019;d said I didn&#x2019;t have what it took to keep my &#x201c;blue-collar pretty-boy&#x201d; husband happy for long.<br> <br>Jack chuckles softly, though there&#x2019;s no mirth in it. &#x201c;No, I definitely did not phone her. What would I tell her, anyway? You weren&#x2019;t exactly informative on the phone. Sounds like you&#x2019;re in some hot water, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>My sigh of relief slides out and I&#x2019;m back to doodling. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they tell me.&#x201d; When the cops started throwing around words like &#x201c;larceny&#x201d; and &#x201c;threats of bodily harm&#x201d;&#x2014;things that sounded excessive and unfitting, but permanently damaging to my fresh and clean adult record should they stick&#x2014;I knew I wasn&#x2019;t going to talk my way out of this one. It didn&#x2019;t help that I used the picture of Caroline for target practice during my rampage, leaving a pair of scissors strategically placed through her eyes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good thing you still have that same law firm. You were easy to find.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack folds his arms over his chest and regards me with an unreadable face. A tiny part of me&#x2014;the angry little girl lost somewhere inside&#x2014;is ready to burst, to demand, &#x201c;How could you have left me? I know why you left my mom, but how could you have shoved me out of your life so easily, too? I didn&#x2019;t cheat on you!&#x201d; But I bite my bottom lip. Pissing off the one person who can help me right now wouldn&#x2019;t be smart. And I need to be smart.<br> <br>Finally Jack leans back in his chair and says, &#x201c;Okay, Reese. Start from the beginning and let&#x2019;s see how we can solve this.&#x201d;<br> <br>I press my lips together to keep from smiling. Not because this is amusing. It&#x2019;s just that we&#x2019;ve been here before. This really is starting to feel like days long since lost, when we&#x2019;d meet up in the kitchen around midnight&#x2014;after Annabelle had gone to sleep, when Jack was finally home from work&#x2014;to contemplate my latest mischief over bowls of ice cream. He&#x2019;s even adopted the same hypnotic tone that always got me talking when my teachers, my guidance counselor, or anyone else really, couldn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m pretty sure he uses it on all of his clients.<br> <br>Twenty minutes later, after I&#x2019;ve given him a rundown of my situation, I hear his disappointed sigh. &#x201c;Working in a pet shop, Reese?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not anymore.&#x201d; After leaving work early with the flu and coming home to the big discovery of Jared and her in the shower&#x2014;oddly enough, the more it replays in my mind, the more it begins to resemble the shower scene from Scarface&#x2014;I spent a week in Lina&#x2019;s bed, heavily sedated with Jim Beam and Nyquil. My boss fired me over the phone.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t care.<br> <br>&#x201c;And eloping in Vegas with a guy? At nineteen years old? After knowing him for six weeks?&#x201d; I know that the chuckle that fills the room now isn&#x2019;t directed at me, even before his words confirm it; Jack&#x2019;s laughing at the irony of it all. &#x201c;And you were always so adamant that you&#x2019;d never get married.&#x201d;<br> <br>I have no answer to that, except a quiet &#x201c;I loved him,&#x201d; as the painful knot forms in my throat, as I fight the sob from tearing out of me. I did. I think I still do, despite how much Jared has hurt me. Since that day eight months ago when I stepped out of my best friend Lina&#x2019;s apartment and quite literally ran into her neighbor, a reincarnation of a mint-eyed Greek demigod, I knew that I had met my soul mate. Fireworks exploded, lightning struck, electricity coursed. All that love-at-first-sight bullshit that I didn&#x2019;t believe in&#x2014;I instantly became a poster child for it. Common sense flew out the window with a cement block tied to its ankle.<br> <br>Jared said he felt it, too.<br> <br>And now, after six months of marital bliss, without a single warning sign, he&#x2019;s back with her.<br> <br>That rotten illness festering inside me enflames with the thought, the humiliating reality a burn that doesn&#x2019;t want to subside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, Reese. I know you&#x2019;ve always had a wild streak in you, even as a little girl. These choices you&#x2019;ve made since I saw you last, though,&#x201d; his head is shaking, &#x201c;possession of marijuana . . . trespassing . . . underage drinking . . . a fistfight?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not really that big a deal. A lot of people drink and smoke pot in high school,&#x201d; I argue, adding, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just the one who kept getting caught.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Drag racing?&#x201d; He stares at me questioningly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Those were derby cars and that was totally blown out of proportion,&#x201d; I clarify.<br> <br>Jack slides his glasses off and gives his face a rough rub, looking exhausted. It&#x2019;s a four-hour drive from Miami to Jacksonville and he arrived here five hours after I called, meaning he pretty much dropped everything to come. I can&#x2019;t help but wonder why he&#x2019;d do that.<br> <br>&#x201c;At least I didn&#x2019;t get knocked up,&#x201d; I joke.<br> <br>By the look of exasperation he shoots me, he doesn&#x2019;t find that remotely funny. &#x201c;I had hoped you were too smart to get into this kind of trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess even smart girls can make a clusterfuck of their lives, can&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; I mutter, though his words sting.<br> <br>Because they&#x2019;re true.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a long pause, where Jack&#x2019;s mouth twists in thought as he regards me. &#x201c;What are you going to do with yourself now, Reese? How are you going to make up for this?&#x201d; When I was little, Jack always asked me for suggestions as to how I should be punished for my various childish misdemeanors. I think it was his way of getting me to agree on the outcome without looking like the harsh stepfather. I was pretty good at coming up with suitable penances and it was definitely preferable to sitting in a chair while my mother shrieked about what an embarrassment I was to her, the gin sloshing out of her martini glass with her mad hand gesticulations.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;m not a little kid anymore and Jack&#x2019;s not asking me to come up with a suitable punishment.

Professor Watson discusses eighteen crops - from sorghum and rye to the watermelon - which spread through the Near East and North Africa during this period. Their origins, diffusion and uses are reviewed. The book investigates the mechanics of diffusion, the routes by which plants spread, and the processes by which they were acclimatized in their new environment. The social and economic history of agriculture in the medieval Islamic world is assessed in a review of wide importance. Professor Watson sets out to refute the view that the early Islamic period was one of agricultural decline in the Near East. He shows that, in contrast to the late Roman and Sasanian periods, it was a time of agricultural and demographic expansion. Agricultural innovation in the early Islamic world will be of interest to economic, social and agricultural historians and to those concerned with Islam and its effect on Africa and Asia.</p><p>This study describes and explains the revolutionary changes which transformed the agricultural life of the Islamicized world in the four centuries following the early Arab conquests.

Under no conditions could a stranger be ignored or taken for granted. Yet in all great cities today, human beings seem to live out their entire lives in &#34;a world of strangers.&#34; How did it become possible for millions of people to do this? How is city life possible? The unique value of A World of Strangers lies in Dr. Lofland&#39;s expert use of rich historical and anthropological sources to answer these questions. She demonstrates that &#34;a potentially chaotic and meaningless world of strangers was transformed into a knowable and predictable world of strangers by the same mechanism humans always use to make their world livable: it was ordered.&#34; Lofland offers a brilliant analysis of the various devices used at different times in history to create social and psychological order in cities, concluding with an analysis of the contemporary city, in which the location of the encounter between strangers has come to replace personal appearance as a means of evaluating others. Dr. Lofland also describes how city people initially learn and then act upon the ordering principles dominant in their society. A World of Strangers is a wonderfully wise and readable account of how we have come to live as we do.</p><p>Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Banfield, The Unheavenly City Revisited (ISBN 0881335290); Gmelch-Zenner, Urban Life: Readings in Urban Anthropology, Fourth Edition (ISBN 157766194X); Howell, Hard Living on Clay Street: Portraits of Blue Collar Families (ISBN 0881335266); and Shannon et al., Urban Problems in Sociological Perspective, Fourth Edition (ISBN 1577661958).</p><h2>Claudian: Volume I (Loeb Classical Library No. 135)</h2><p><p>Claudius Claudianus, Latin poet of great affairs, flourished during the joint reigns (394&#x2013;5 CE onwards) of the brothers Honorius (Emperor in the West) and Arcadius (in the East). Apparently a native of Greek Alexandria in Egypt, he was, to judge by his name, of Roman descent, though his first writings were in Greek, and his pure Latin may have been learned by him as a foreign language. About 395 CE he moved to Italy (Milan and Rome) and though really a pagan, became a professional court-poet composing for Christian rulers works which give us important knowledge of Honorius's time.</p><p>A panegyric on the brothers Probinus and Olybrius (consuls together in 395) was followed during ten years by other poems (mostly epics in hexameters): in praise of consulships of Honorius (395, 398, 404 CE); against the Byzantine ministers Rufinus (396) and Eutropius (399); in praise of the consulship (400) of Stilicho (Honorius's guardian, general, and minister); in praise of Stilicho's wife Serena; mixed metres on the marriage of Honorius to their daughter Maria; on the war with the rebel Gildo in Africa (398); on the Getic or Gothic war (402); on Stilicho's success against the Goth Alaric (403); on the consulship of Manlius Theodorus (399); and on the wedding of Palladius and Celerina. Less important are non-official poems such as the three books of a mythological epic on the Rape of Proserpina, unfinished as was also a Battle of Giants (in Greek). Noteworthy are Phoenix, Senex Veronensis, elegiac prefaces, and the epistles, epigrams, and idylls.</p><p>Through the patronage of Stilicho or through Serena, Claudius in 404 married well in Africa and was granted a statue in Rome. Nothing is known of him after 404. In his poetry are true poetic as well as rhetorical skill, command of language, polished style, diversity, vigour, satire, dignity, bombast, artificiality, flattery, and other virtues and faults of the earlier 'silver' age in Latin.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Claudian is in two volumes.</p></p><p></p><h2>Resentment in History</h2><p>This book, by a renowned and distinguished historian, is an arresting account of the role that resentment has played throughout history, from Antiquity and early Christianity through to the present day.<br><br>At the origin of resentment we always find an injury, an act of humiliation, an affront, a trauma. Those who feel victimized cannot react because they are powerless. They brood on their desire for revenge, which they cannot satisfy but which constantly nags at them. Until finally they explode with anger. This period of waiting may also be accompanied by a repudiation of the oppressor's values and a rehabilitation of the victim's own values, and this gives the oppressed new strength, fuelling the act of revolt or revenge.<br><br>Ferro effortlessly weaves together historical examples such as the role played by resentment in the French and Russian revolutions, the resentment against the historical suffering of African Americans that<br>underpinned the Civil Rights movement and the rise of black power, and the revival of resentment by proponents of radical Islam whose violent acts of terror in New York, London and elsewhere have shaken the world.</p><p><b>Marc Ferro </b>is Director of Studies in Social Sciences at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes in Paris.<br>"Ferro's eye for telling details and his acute <i>aper�us</i> keep the reader engaged.

What determines which become law? Is it the public? Do we have government &#34;of the people, by the people, for the people?&#34; Or is it those who have the resources to organize and pressure government who get what they want? In the first study ever of a random sample of policy proposals, Paul Burstein finds that the public can get what it wants - but mainly on the few issues that attract its attention. Does this mean organized interests get what they want? Not necessarily - on most issues there is so little political activity that it hardly matters. Politics may be less of a battle between the public and organized interests than a struggle for attention. American society is so much more complex than it was when the Constitution was written that we may need to reconsider what it means, in fact, to be a democracy.</p><p>What most strongly influences Congress? Is it the public, or those with the resources to pressure government? This book is the first to examine what influences Congress across the hundreds of issues it deals with, and produces some surprising conclusions. The public can get what it wants on issues it cares about, but it doesn&#39;t care about many. And on most issues there is too little pressure on government to matter. Politics may be less of a battle between the public and organized interests than most people think - and what it means to be a democracy under such circumstances is very much an open question.Paul Burstein is Professor of Sociology, Adjunct Professor of Political Science, and Samuel and Althea Stroum Chair in Jewish Studies at the University of Washington, Seattle.

By focusing on the inherent delight and curiosity behind young children&#x2019;s mathematical reasoning, learning trajectories ultimately make teaching more joyous. They help teachers understand the varying levels of knowledge exhibited by individual students, which in turn allows them to better meet the learning needs of all children. Using straightforward, no-nonsense language, this book summarizes the current research about how children learn mathematics, and how to build on what children already know to realize more effective teaching.</p> <p>This second edition of <em>Learning and Teaching Early Math</em> remains the definitive, research-based resource to help teachers understand the learning trajectories of early mathematics and become quintessential professionals. </p> <p>Updates to the new edition include:</p> <p>�&nbsp;Explicit connections between Learning Trajectories and the new Common Core State Standards.</p> <p>�&nbsp;New coverage of patterns and patterning.</p> <p>�&nbsp;Incorporation of hundreds of recent research studies.</p></p><p><p>Douglas H.

What concepts and skills are foundational for their reaching the next level of math understanding? And how can teachers help children grasp each new idea and remain enthusiastic about math? These are the key questions in this incredibly valuable book from Douglas Clements and Julie Sarama. For each topic area, they clearly describe the developmental path, or &#x2018;learning trajectory,&#x2019; along which children move to develop mathematical concepts and skills. And they offer evidence-based guidelines and instructional activities in an engaging, straightforward way that reflects their deep respect for, and understanding of, what teachers do.&#x201d; &#x2015;</em><strong>Carol Copple, Former Director, Publications and Initiatives in Educational Practice, National Association for the Education of Young Children</strong><br><br></p> <p><em>"One of the book's greatest strengths is the focus on 'Developmental Trajectories', which are a little like 'schemas'.

This provocative book exposes the dictator&#x2019;s preoccupation with his private persona, which was shaped by the aesthetic and ideological management of his domestic architecture. Hitler&#x2019;s bachelor life stirred rumors, and the Nazi regime relied on the dictator&#x2019;s three dwellings&#x2014;the Old Chancellery in Berlin, his apartment in Munich, and the Berghof, his mountain home on the Obersalzberg&#x2014;to foster the myth of the F�hrer as a morally upstanding and refined man. Author Despina Stratigakos also reveals the previously untold story of Hitler&#x2019;s interior designer, Gerdy Troost, through newly discovered archival sources.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the height of the Third Reich, media outlets around the world showcased Hitler&#x2019;s homes to audiences eager for behind-the-scenes stories. After the war, fascination with Hitler&#x2019;s domestic life continued as soldiers and journalists searched his dwellings for insights into his psychology. The book&#x2019;s rich illustrations, many previously unpublished, offer readers a rare glimpse into the decisions involved in the making of Hitler&#x2019;s homes and into the sheer power of the propaganda that influenced how the world saw him.</p><p>This revelatory history looks at the residences of Adolf Hitler, illuminating their powerful role in constructing and promoting the dictator&#x2019;s private persona both within Germany and abroad.<br><b>Despina Stratigakos </b>is professor of architecture at the State University of New York at Buffalo.</p><h2>The Role of Mathematics in Science (ANNELI LAX NEW MATHEMATICAL LIBRARY)</h2><p>The Role of Mathematics in Science aims to illustrate the many ways in which mathematical methods have helped discovery in science.

While touching on the general social, political, and economic climate in which the NAACP acted, Mark V. Tushnet emphasizes the internal workings of the organization as revealed in its own documents. He argues that the dedication and political and legal skills of staff members such as Walter White, Charles Hamilton Houston, and Thurgood Marshall were responsible for the ultimate success of public interest law. This edition contains a new epilogue by the author that addresses general questions of litigation strategy, the contested question of whether the Brown decision mattered, and the legacy of Brown through the Burger and Rehnquist courts.</p><p>"Skillfully cutting through the maze of legal technicalities and jargon to make clear the strategy of the NAACP, [Tushnet] has presented an extraordinary case study."-- <i>Journal of American History</i> <br>Tushnet shows how the skills, personalities, and talent in the NAACP legal team led to the success of the first public interest litigation campaign.

In this authoritative and accessible account of Italian opera, David Kimbell introduces those who, over three hundred years, created not only a national tradition but the central tradition from which others have drawn their inspiration. He traces the history of Italian opera from its origins in the humanism of the Renaissance to Puccini in the early twentieth century, drawing attention not only to musical issues but also to the social, literary, and philosophical ideas that have shaped modern Italian civilization.</p><p>Tracing the history of Italian opera from its origins in the humanism of the Renaissance to Puccini in the early twentieth century, this authoritative account draws attention to influential social, literary and philosophical ideas as well as musical issues.Kimbell (music, Univ. of Edinburgh) has penned an ambitious operatic history which presents opera as a reflection of Italy's culture and history. Many disparate elements have influenced the development of a genre so closely defined with Italy, and readers with access to scores or recordings of the works discussed will be particulary appreciative. A recent photo of Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti graces the dust jacket, but material on modern productions and singers is absent. This should appeal to fans familiar with the Italian operatic repertoire rather than the opera neophyte, in part because of the many musical examples which capture and illustrate changing operatic styles, as well as the distinctive traits of various composers.

More than four million homes were lost to foreclosures. Is it a coincidence that the United States witnessed a dramatic rise in household debt in the years before the recession&#x2015;that the total amount of debt for American households <i>doubled </i>between 2000 and 2007 to $14 trillion? Definitely not. Armed with clear and powerful evidence, Atif Mian and Amir Sufi reveal in <i>House of Debt</i> how the Great Recession and Great Depression, as well as the current economic malaise in Europe, were caused by a large run-up in household debt followed by a significantly large drop in household spending.<br><br> Though the banking crisis captured the public&#x2019;s attention, Mian and Sufi argue strongly with actual data that current policy is too heavily biased toward protecting banks and creditors. Increasing the flow of credit, they show, is disastrously counterproductive when the fundamental problem is too much debt. As their research shows, excessive household debt leads to foreclosures, causing individuals to spend less and save more. Less spending means less demand for goods, followed by declines in production and huge job losses. How do we end such a cycle? With a direct attack on debt, say Mian and Sufi. &nbsp;More aggressive debt forgiveness after the crash helps, but as they illustrate, we can be rid of painful bubble-and-bust episodes only if the financial system moves away from its reliance on inflexible debt contracts. As an example, they propose new mortgage contracts that are built on the principle of risk-sharing, a concept that would have prevented the housing bubble from emerging in the first place.<br><br> Thoroughly grounded in compelling economic evidence, <i>House of Debt </i>offers convincing answers to some of the most important questions facing the modern economy today: Why do severe recessions happen? Could we have prevented the Great Recession and its consequences? And what actions are needed to prevent such crises going forward?</p><p><b>Atif Mian</b> is the Theodore A. Wells '29 Professor of Economics at Princeton University and director of the Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance. <b>Amir Sufi</b> is the Chicago Board of Trade Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.&#x201c;The most important economics book of 2014; it could be the most important book to come out of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession. Its arguments deserve careful attention, and its publication provides an opportunity to reconsider policy choices made in 2009 and 2010 regarding mortgage debt. &nbsp;<i>House of Debt</i> is important because it persuasively demonstrates that the conventional meta-narrative of the crisis and its aftermath, which emphasizes the breakdown of financial intermediation, is inadequate. . . . All future work on financial crises will have to reckon with the household balance sheet effects they stress. After their work, we can still believe in the necessity of financial rescues; however, we can no longer believe in their sufficiency. And after their work, we have an important new agenda of reforms to consider if future crises are to be prevented.&#x201d; (Lawrence Summers <i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Mian and Sufi are convinced that the Great Recession could have been just another ordinary, lowercase recession if the federal government had acted more aggressively to help homeowners by reducing mortgage debts. The two men &#x2014; economics professors who are part of a new generation of scholars whose work relies on enormous data sets &#x2014; argue . . . that the government misunderstood the deepest recession since the 1930s. They are particularly critical of Timothy&nbsp;Geithner, the former Treasury secretary, and Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, for focusing on preserving the financial system without addressing what the authors regard as the underlying and more important problem of excessive household debt. They say the recovery remains painfully sluggish as a result.&#x201d; (Binyamin Appelbaum <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A concise and powerful account of how the great recession happened and what should be done to avoid another one. Atif Mian, an economist at Princeton University, and Amir Sufi, a finance professor at the University of Chicago, make a strong circumstantial case that household debt was the recession's main culprit. They also find it skulking in the background of previous downturns, usually loitering in the vicinity of a housing bubble. . . . <i>House of Debt</i> is clear, well-argued and consistently informative. . . . Mian and Sufi's proposal to shift much of the risk of falling home prices to lenders&#x2014;while rewarding them for their trouble&#x2014;is a good place to start. If we don't put moralizing aside and analyze dispassionately what caused the last crisis, we areunlikely to prevent the next one.&#x201d; (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Subsequent reforms to our financial system give policymakers more tools to police housing finance, yet the continuing over-reliance on debt and a lack of good jobs leaves families at risk and exposes our economy to the whipsaw of another debt-fueled credit bubble. Mian and Sufi deserve credit of another kind for detailing how ensnared the American Dream is in this tangled web of debt finance&#x2014;and how exposed the vast majority of us are to the broader economic consequences.&nbsp;&#x201c; (<i>Atlantic</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Distills lessons about the crisis from their recent research into one easily digestible package.&#x201d; (<i>Economist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Sufi and Mian have been publishing important work on this topic for the last eight years, beginning well before the 2008 crisis. Their arguments are compelling and deserve widespread attention, especially at a time when Tim Geithner and others are trying to rewrite history &#x2013; and when many homeowners still need help.&#x201d; (Richard Eskow <i>Huffington Post</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The economists Mian and Sufi are our leading experts on the problems created by debt overhang (and the authors of an important new book on the subject, <i>House of Debt</i>); they looked at Geithner&#x2019;s claims about the benefits of debt relief to the economy and showed that they are absurdly low, far below anything current research suggests.&#x201d; (Paul Krugman <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>House of Debt</i>, their brilliant new book . . . Mian and Sufi detail the ways in which the housing bust damaged the economic well-being low- and middle-income households across the country.&#x201d; (<i>National Review</i>)<br><br><i>&#x201c;House of Debt</i>&nbsp;by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi of Princeton University and the University of Chicago, respectively, reads things a bit differently and, to my mind, more sagely. The authors contend that Geithner and colleagues erred mightily in not focusing more on homeowners. Homeowners&#x2019; post-bubble mortgage debt overhang was a much greater long-term threat to the macroeconomy than was bank failure. It was also, as I and others argued at the time, the ultimate source of bank peril itself. Rescuing homeowners would accordingly have offered a twofer, binding the wounds that the bailouts could but bandage. . . . Superior to Geithner&#x2019;s take on the crisis.&#x201d; (<i>The Hill</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Much has been written about the boom and subsequent bust that rocked the US economy during 2007&#x2013;2009, but insightful and informed analysis is much rarer. This book is one of those rare gems. It offers an in-depth look at the state of housing, consumer credit, household incomes, and debt around the crisis and presents an informed discussion about its causes and consequences. The analysis of crisis resolution has resonance, not only for the United States, but for the many countries that are still entangled in severe financial difficulties.&#x201d; (Carmen Reinhart, Harvard University)</p><h2>A History of the World&#39;s Religions</h2><p>This book is the most thorough, yet concise history of world religions available in a single volume, discussing many subjects largely neglected in other book.

His preface to the first edition spoke of two special needs to be met: to include descriptive and interpretative details from the original source materials, and to bridge the interval between the founding of religions and their present state ....The study of world religions needs to encompass the immediate and the existential as well as the rational; the empathic as well as the analytical. Serving as the editor of John's book has been, on the one hand, a challenge to emend each inaccuracy and enhance each strength, but also a profound experience of what it is like to look out on the world through the eyes of a wise person." </p> <p> &#x2014; DAVID S.

It&#x2019;s stretched to the limit when one of the nurse&#x2019;s home health care patients turns up dead.Now Ceepak and Danny must answer the hard and horrible question: &#x201c;Did we just help a friend get away with murder?&#x201d;Get ready for another fun and fast-paced page-turner from Anthony and Agatha award-winner Chris Grabenstein.</p><p>Chris Grabenstein is the Anthony and Agatha Award-winning author of the critically acclaimed thrill reads Tilt A Whirl, Mad Mouse, Whack A Mole, Hell Hole, Mind Scrambler, and Rolling Thunder, plus the young adult chillers The Crossroads and The Hanging Hill. He lives in New York City.It&#x2019;s early June and, despite Hurricane Sandy, Sea Haven, New Jersey, is ready for another &#x201c;sunny, funderful&#x201d; summer. But straight-arrow Detective John Ceepak and his wisecracking partner, Danny Boyle, really have their hands full. A 94-year-old retired dentist has been murdered, and yet another hot friend of Danny&#x2019;s, an RN who provided live-in care to the victim, is a prime suspect, along with the dentist&#x2019;s wildly dysfunctional family. Meanwhile, the new mayor, who owns a boardwalk amusement pier, has purchased a second-hand thrill ride&#x2014;a Free Fall, which was involved in a fatal accident in its former location&#x2014;and he has hired Ceepak&#x2019;s odious father, who arrives quoting Bible verse, to operate it. These disparate plot threads collide to produce a bloody denouement that leaves Ceepak and Boyle at risk. Free Fall was essentially completed when Sandy hit, but Grabenstein acknowledges the hurricane in an author&#x2019;s note and alludes to a future Ceepak novel set during the storm. For now, though, Sea Haven abides, complete with Springsteen lyrics, sleuthing, characters both honorable and awful, and, of course, deep-fried Snickers bars. --Thomas Gaughan</p><h2>Twelfth Night (Arden Shakespeare Second Series)</h2><p>Unique features include an extensive overview of Shakespeare&#39;s life, world, and theater by the general editor of Signet Classic Shakespeare series, plus a special introduction to the play by the editor Sylvan Barnet, Tufts University.

T&#39;ao, in the author&#39;s opinion, is of all the major Chinese poets especially concerned with personal integrity and the meaning of man&#39;s life. His poetry for this reason may be able to transcend the barriers of cultural difference. For centuries of Chinese readers, however, the image of T&#39;ao Yuan-ming as an eccentric wine-loving recluse who embraced purity and simplicity and rejected the corruption of political society has virtually been as important as his own writing. Studies of the poet, from the Sung dynasty on, have applied a political interpretation of his work. The author believes that this approach is generally mistaken and seeks to combat it in detail. The work has been arranged in two volumes. The first, containing the translations with explanatory commentary and notes, is aimed at a wider audience than the professional.
